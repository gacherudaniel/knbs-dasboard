# Statistical Infrastructure and Methodology

## Metadata

Statistical metadata are data and other documentation that describe statistical data and statistical processes in a standardized way by providing information on data sources, methods, definitions, classifications and data quality.

### Statistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX )

A Set of technical standards and content-oriented guidelines, together with an IT architecture and tools, to be used for the efficient exchange and sharing of statistical data and metadata.

### SDMX Glossary

An SDMX guideline containing concepts and related definitions that are useful for building and understanding data and metadata exchange arrangements based on SDMX.

### Data Structure Definition (DSD)

A Set of structural metadata associated to a Data Set, which includes information about how concepts are associated with the Measures, Dimensions, and Attributes of a data cube, along with information about the Representation of data and related descriptive metadata.

### SDMX Global Registry

Technical infrastructure containing publicly available metadata material, data structure definitions (DSD), and related artefacts (concept schemes, metadata structure definitions, code lists, etc.).

### Data Documentation Initiative (DDI)

An international standard for describing metadata from surveys, questionnaires, statistical data files, and social sciences study-level information. DDI focuses on microdata and tabulation of aggregates /indicators.

### Generic Statistical Information Model (GSIM)

A conceptual model that provides a set of standardized information objects, inputs and outputs in the design and production of statistics, regardless of the subject matter.

### Generic Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM)

A standard that describes and defines the set of business processes needed to produce official statistics. The customized model used by the KNBS is known as Kenya Statistical Process Model (KSPM).

### Paradata

Data about the processes by which statistics are compiled**.**

## Statistical Classifications

A set of categories which may be assigned to one or more variables registered in statistical surveys or administrative files, and used in the production and dissemination of statistics. The categories are defined in terms of one or more characteristics of a particular population of units of observation. A statistical classification may have a flat, linear structure or may be hierarchically structured, such that all categories at lower levels are sub-categories of a category at the next level up. The categories at each level of the classification structure must be mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive of all objects in the population of interest.

### Broad Economic Category (BEC)

 A classification, which groups commodities according to their main end use.

### Central Product Classification (CPC)

A classification based on the physical characteristics of goods or on the nature of the services rendered. Each type of good or service distinguished in the CPC is defined in such a way that it is normally produced by only one activity as defined in ISIC. The CPC covers products that are an output of economic activities, including transportable goods, non-transportable goods and services.

### Classification of Functions of Government (COFOG)

A classification used to identify the socio-economic objectives of current transactions, capital outlays and acquisition of financial assets by general government and its sub-sectors

### Classification of Individual Consumption according to Purpose (COICOP)

A classification used to classify individual consumption expenditures by households, non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs), and general government according to their purpose.

### Classification of Statistical Activities (CSA)

An analytical classification that provides a hierarchical structure of categories about statistical activities. It is organized by statistical domains, which can be further broken down into sub-domains and specific activities.

### Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System (HS)

The HS is an internationally adopted commodity classification system developed by the World Customs Organization (WCO). It provides a detailed nomenclature for classifying traded goods based on their **nature**, primarily to meet customs and statistical requirements.

### Standard International Trade Classification (SITC)

It is an international classification system for traded goods developed by the United Nations. It classifies commodities based on criteria such as materials used, processing stage, market practices, and economic significance, making it particularly suitable for economic analysis and international trade comparisons. Unlike the HS, which is focused on the nature of the commodity for customs purposes, the SITC groups products by their stage of production to support analytical applications.

### International Classification of Disease (ICD)

This is an international standard for recording, reporting, and monitoring diseases and health conditions. It provides a common language for health professionals worldwide and enables the systematic classification of diseases, disorders, injuries, and other health-related conditions.

### International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC)

It is a coherent and consistent classification structure of economic activities based on a set of internationally agreed concepts, definitions, principles and classification rules. It provides a comprehensive framework within which economic data can be collected and reported in a format that is designed for purposes of economic analysis, decision-taking and policy-making.

### Kenya Standard Industrial Classification (KeSIC) of All Economic Activities

This is a domesticated version of the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC Rev. 4), modified to suit Kenya's specific economic context. Notable changes include the introduction of 52 new classes, 973 sub-class 1 codes, and 1,180 sub-class 2 codes, which allow for a deeper disaggregation of economic activities unique to Kenya. It also includes categories to capture the informal and subsistence activities.

### International Classification of Activities for Time-Use Statistics (ICATUS)

This is a classification of all the activities on which a person may spend time during the 24 hours that make up a day. Its purpose is to serve as a standard framework for time-use statistics based on activities grouped in a meaningful way.

### International Standard Classification of Occupation (ISCO)

A system for classifying and aggregating jobs and occupations into groups according to the tasks and duties undertaken in the job. The system classifies persons according to their actual and potential relation with jobs. Jobs are classified with respect to the type of work performed or to be performed. The basic criteria used to define the system of major, sub-major, minor and unit groups is the 'skill' level and 'skill specialisation' required to carry out the tasks and duties of the occupations

### Kenya National Occupational Classifications (KNOCS)

This is a system used to categorize and classify jobs within the Kenyan labor market. It's designed to standardize the way occupations are defined and organized, facilitating the collection and analysis of labor market information. KNOCS is modeled on the [International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO)](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEA_enKE1123KE1123&cs=1&sca_esv=1db88746b10c644a&sxsrf=AE3TifPOxISIqdyOgDz4Arc5iizMLOIAcQ%3A1752554347809&q=International+Standard+Classification+of+Occupations+%28ISCO%29&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjc1uPahb6OAxW9Z0EAHX8tF0MQxccNegQIBRAB&mstk=AUtExfA3p7a5i8jTKR2JW2_jLkkJdeRdiyX0hn1r5KSJUEsGzsEE6qXSnFjUzyED0lps2nWKNmS0TBU3qufH87ZnbPjqQuYIatRaxO1JlUVt4HWWAAwaMFodXRXo4IsIMyZiRFcGIggdmjGhvWJV2dTKw5SQrVnMLX7Dl2LpcIoc_GmqKNs&csui=3).

### International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)

### International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standards

It is a standard that provides the fundamentals and vocabulary for quality management systems (QMS). It establishes the essential principles and terminology to help organizations ensure their products and services consistently meet customer and regulatory requirements.

### System of National Accounts (SNA)

This is the internationally agreed standard set of recommendations on how to compile measures of economic activity in accordance with strict accounting conventions based on economic principles. The recommendations are expressed in terms of a set of concepts, definitions, classifications and accounting rules that comprise the internationally agreed standard for measuring such items as gross domestic product (GDP), the most frequently quoted indicator of economic performance. The accounting framework of the SNA allows economic data to be compiled and presented in a format that is designed for purposes of economic analysis, decision-taking and policymaking. The accounts themselves present in a condensed way a great mass of detailed information, organized according to economic principles and perceptions, about the working of an economy.

### International Standard Book Number (ISBN)

This is a unique identifier for books, eBooks, and other published materials. It serves as a standardized way to identify a particular edition of a book and is used by publishers, booksellers, libraries, and distributors to efficiently manage and locate specific titles in the global marketplace.

### Digital Object Identifier (DOI)

A unique, persistent identifying number for online information resources that provides its permanent, precise identifier regardless of its location on the Internet.

## Statistical registers

### Statistical Business Register

#### A Statistical Business Register (SBR)

A statistical business register (SBR) is a set of businesses, including all the characteristics of those businesses required to provide frames for business surveys. More broadly interpreted, an SBR is these data together with the procedures, systems and human resources that support their use. In operational terms, it is a regularly updated, structured database that contains organizational, administrative and statistical units describing businesses in a country or region, that is maintained by a dedicated staff, supported by a purpose-built software system and that is used by an NSO to create frames for business surveys and sometimes as a direct source of counts of businesses by type, size, geography, economic activity, etc.

#### Institutional unit

An entity that is capable, in its own right, of owning assets, incurring liabilities and engaging in economic activities and in transactions with other entities. There are two types of institutional units, namely legal entities and households.

#### Institutional sector

This is an aggregation of institutional units on the basis of the type of producer and depending on their principal activity and function, which are considered to be indicative of their economic behaviour. A sector is divided into sub-sectors according to the criteria relevant to that sector; this permits a more precise description of the economic behaviour of the unit.

#### 60301.3.1 Non-financial corporations

#### Households

Are institutional units consisting of one individual or a group of individuals. All physical persons in the economy must belong to one and only one household. The principal functions of households are to supply labour, to undertake final consumption and, as entrepreneurs, to produce market goods and non-financial (and possibly financial) services. The entrepreneurial activities of a household consist of unincorporated enterprises that remain within the household except under certain specific conditions.

####  Non-profit institutions serving households (N-PISHs)

A group of enterprises can have more than one decision-making centre, especially for policy decisions on production, sales and profits. It may centralize certain aspects of financial management and taxation. It constitutes an economic entity which is empowered to make choices, particularly concerning the units which it comprises

#### Unincorporated enterprise

A producer unit which is not incorporated as a legal entity separate from the owner (household, government or foreign resident); the fixed and other assets used in unincorporated enterprises do not belong to the enterprises but to their owners, the enterprises as such cannot engage in transactions with other economic units nor can they enter into contractual relationships with other units nor incur liabilities on their own behalf; in addition, their owners are personally liable, without limit, for any debts or obligations incurred in the course of production.

#### A multinational enterprise group (MNE)

 It is defined as a group of enterprises or legal units that are controlled by a common parent and have business establishments in at least two different countries.

#### Truncated enterprise groups

It consists of the enterprises and the legal units of a multinational enterprise group, which are resident in the same country. It may comprise only one unit, if the other units are non-resident. An enterprise may be the truncated group or part thereof. A truncated group may consist of several units and subgroups, which can appear seemingly unlinked if their parent is non-resident, but actually belong to the same multinational enterprise.

#### All-resident groups

It consists exclusively of enterprises or legal units that are resident in the same country, regardless of their organizational or ownership links.

#### Legal status

Refers to the legal form or classification of an entity recognized by law, indicating its existence as a legal unit that can own property, enter contracts, incur liabilities, and be held responsible legally. It defines whether the entity is, for example, a corporation, limited liability company, partnership, sole proprietorship, or a natural person engaged in economic activity.

#### Sole Proprietorship

#### Local Private Company

A privately owned enterprise legally registered and operating within a single country, typically characterized by identity as a legal unit or enterprise that is resident and active under local laws and regulations. It excludes entities publicly owned or controlled by multinational groups and focuses on private, often smaller-scale business units serving local or national markets.

#### Nonprofit Organizations/Institutions 

Are legal or social entities created for the purpose of producing goods and services but whose status does not permit them to be a source of income, profit or other financial gain for the units that establish, control or finance them.

#### Faith Based Organization

This refers to the name, description or style under which a business is carried as registered with the registrar of companies in terms of the Registration of Business Names Act.

#### Shareholder

Any person, company, or any other legal entity that owns at least one share in a company. A shareholder may also be referred to as a stockholder. Shareholders are the owners of the company. They have the potential to profit if the company does well, but that comes with the potential to lose if the company does poorly. A shareholder can also be someone who holds shares of stock in a corporation.

#### Statutory Corporation

#### Activity

A process, or a combination of actions that result in a certain set of products. Activities are defined as the use of inputs (e.g. capital, labour, energy, and materials) to produce outputs. The outputs that result from undertaking activities can be transferred or sold to other units (in market or non-market transactions), placed in inventory or used by the producing units for own final use.

#### Secondary activity

Separate activity that produces products eventually for third parties and that is not the principal activity of the unit in question. The outputs of secondary activities are secondary products. Most economic entities produce at least some secondary products.

#### Principal activity

The activity which contributes most to the total value added of the unit under consideration. Ideally, the principal activity of the unit should be determined with reference to the value added to the goods and services produced, by applying the top-down method.

#### Ancillary activity

###### Activities are undertaken to support principal and secondary productive activities of a unit by providing goods or services entirely or primarily for the use of that entity, such as bookkeeping, transportation, storage, purchasing, sales promotion, cleaning, repair and maintenance, security etc. The output is always intended for intermediate consumption within the same unit and is therefore usually not recorded separately.

#### Number of employees

Those persons who work for an employer and who have a contract of employment and receive compensation in the form of wages, salaries, fees, gratuities, piecework pay or remuneration in kind. A worker from an employment agency is considered to be an employee of that employment agency and not of the units in which he or she works, including temporarily.

#### Historical register

#### Frozen frame

A subset of the snapshot that comprises all statistical units that are active, or potentially active, or active within the previous reference year. It also includes administrative units that are linked to these statistical units. It contains all the active statistical units in a snapshot that have sufficient information associated with them for sample selection purposes.

#### Domestically controlled enterprise group

###### A multinational group where the global decision-centre is in the country compiling the business register.

#### Death of an enterprise

The dissolution of a combination of production factors with the restriction that no other enterprises are involved in the event. Deaths do not include exits from the population due to mergers, take-overs, break-ups or restructuring of a set of enterprises. It does not include exits from a sub-population resulting only from a change of activity.

#### Death of an enterprise group

The cessation of all control links, direct or indirect, between the legal units of which the enterprise group consists. The legal units become independent again or cease to exist. No other enterprise group is involved. Death applies only to all-resident and multinational groups, not to truncated groups, which cease to exist through other events.

#### Control

###### A single institutional unit owning more than a half of the shares, or equity, of a corporation is able to control its policy and operations by outvoting all other shareholders, if necessary. Similarly, a small, organized group of shareholders whose combined ownership of shares exceeds 50 per cent of the total is able to control the corporation by acting in concert.

#### Characteristic/Variable

###### A set of information that is stored in a business register to describe a statistical unit. Characteristics are provided for identification of a unit like name, address, and identification numbers, for economic description of a unit, like activity code, turnover or employment of a unit or for the structure of a unit, like the relationship to other statistical units.

#### Birth (of enterprise group)

###### The establishing of a link of control, direct or indirect, between two or more independent legal units, where no link of control existed before and no other enterprise group is involved.

#### Birth (of enterprise)

###### The creation of a combination of production factors with the restriction that no other enterprises are involved in the event. Births do not include creation of entries into the population due to mergers, break-ups, split-off or restructuring of a set of enterprises. It does not include entries into a sub-population resulting only from a change of activity. A birth means the enterprise starts from scratch and actually starts activity. An enterprise creation can be considered as an enterprise birth if new production factors, in particular new jobs, are created. If a dormant unit is reactivated within two years, this event is not considered a birth.

####  Registers of population

An individualized data system, that is, a mechanism of continuous recording, and/or of coordinated linkage, of selected information pertaining to each member of the resident population of a country in such a way to provide the possibility of determining up-to-date information concerning the size and characteristics of that population at selected time intervals.

#### Registers of dwellings and buildings

Referred to in some countries as real estate registers are registers usually held by land and property valuation agencies, land survey authorities or by local or municipal authorities responsible for the development of housing policies and urban planning. With respect to a register-based population census such registers are of fundamental importance in the harmonisation of the population register, in that every person that is allocated a dwelling number can be associated with a particular housing unit, and (in some cases) a distinct household. 

####  Agricultural registers

An up-to-date, continuously maintained list of agricultural holdings and their characteristics, including information on holders, land use, livestock, crops, machinery, labour force and other relevant variables, used to support the design of agricultural censuses, surveys and statistical programs.

#### Agricultural holder

### Population and housing censuses

#### Population Census

A population census is the total process of planning, collecting, compiling, evaluating, disseminating and analysing demographic, economic and social data at the smallest relevant geographical level pertaining, at a specified time, to all persons in a country or in a well-delimited part of a country.

#### Housing censuses

A housing census is (similarly) the total process of planning, collecting, compiling, evaluating, disseminating and analysing statistical data relating to the number and condition of housing units and facilities as available to the households pertaining, at a specified time, to all living quarters and its occupants in a country or in a well-delimited part of a country.

#### Base register

A register that holds the basic information relating to the stock of the entire set of 'population' units that are being counted in the census – typically persons, dwellings and buildings.

#### A centralised population register

A network of local registers that are linked in a coordinated way. Although the national population register may be a virtual entity based on the linkage of population registers established at the local level (decentralized system), the overall geographical coverage must be of the entire territory of the country.

### Business and agricultural censuses

#### Economic census

A complete enumeration of all economic establishments engaged in production and/or distribution of goods and services within a country or territory, at a specified point or period in time.

#### Agricultural Census/Census of Agriculture:

A statistical operation for collecting, processing and disseminating data on the structure of agriculture, covering the whole or a significant part of the country.

### Household and individual surveys

#### Household survey

A household survey is a method of data collection in which information is collected from a sample of households, usually using face-to-face interviews, postal questionnaires, or telephone interviews.

#### Area sampling

A probability sampling method in which geographical areas are used as the primary sampling units, and samples are selected by first dividing the population into geographic units (such as blocks, villages, or enumeration areas) and then sampling within these areas.

#### List sampling

List sampling is a probability sampling method in which the sampling frame is a complete, up-to-date list of all units in the target population, and units are selected directly from this list using random or systematic methods.

#### Clustering

Clustering means dividing the population into naturally occurring or practical groups (clusters) — like villages, city blocks, or schools.

#### Cluster sampling

A sampling method in which the population is divided into clusters and a sample of these clusters is selected. Either all units within each selected cluster are observed or a sample of units within each cluster is selected.

#### Cluster size

The number of sampling units included in a single cluster in a cluster sampling design.

#### Compact cluster

A small area such as an EA in which a fixed number of households is selected and enumerated. Compact clusters are used to ensure that households are near each other, making fieldwork practical and economical

#### Non‑compact cluster

A cluster in which the sampling units (e.g., households, dwellings, farms) are not physically concentrated in a small, contiguous area, but are instead spread out or dispersed over a wider geographical area.

#### Complex sample design

A survey sampling design that includes features such as stratification, clustering, multi-stage selection, or unequal selection probabilities to improve efficiency, precision, and feasibility compared to simple random sampling.

#### Confidence level

The degree of statistical confidence with which precision or margin of error around the survey estimate is obtained. The 95 per cent confidence level is generally regarded as the standard.

#### Design effect (deff)

A measure of efficiency of a complex sampling procedure compared to simple random sampling, defined as the ratio between the standard error using the given sample design and the standard error that would result if a simple random sample had been used.

#### Survey domain

A sub-population for which separate estimation of the main indicators is required/or is to be provided.

#### Estimator

A rule or method of estimating a parameter of a population.  It is usually expressed as a function of sample values and hence is a variable whose distribution is of great importance in assessing the reliability of the estimate to which it leads.

#### Stratification

The process by which the survey population is divided into subgroups or strata that are as homogeneous as possible based on certain criteria. The principal objective of stratification is to reduce sampling errors.

#### Explicitstratification

The actual process of dividing the sampling units into specified strata.

#### Implicit stratification

Stratifying of a sample frame through geographic sorting , coupled with systematic sampling to achieve the effect of stratification.

#### Intra‑class correlation

A statistical measure used in cluster sampling to show how strongly units within the same cluster resemble each other.

#### Master sample

A large sample drawn from a census frame and prepared for use in a number of surveys, from which sub-samples can be selected for specific surveys.

#### Measure of size (MOS)

The measure of size is an auxiliary variable, such as the number of households or population of an area, used to assign probabilities of selection for sampling units. For example, the number of households in an EA.

#### Probability Sampling

Sample selection method in which the units are selected randomly with known and nonzero probabilities. This is the only way to obtain unbiased estimates and to be able to measure the precision of the survey indicators by estimating the sampling errors.

#### Non‑probability sampling

Sampling method in which the units are selected subjectively (non-random). Examples of non-probability sampling methods include: quota, judgmental, purposive, convenience, random walk sampling.

#### Non‑sampling error

Errors in estimates which arise from sources other than sampling variation. Examples include coverage errors, response errors, non-response errors, and processing errors.

#### Content errors

Theseare errors in the characteristics of persons counted, resulting from incorrect reporting or recording or from failure to report.

#### Coverage errors

These are non-sampling errors that result from omitting a unit that should have been included, including a unit more than once, or including a unit that should not have been included.

#### Sampled population (or survey population)

The population that is actually covered by the sampling frame is called the survey population or sampled population.

#### Sample

Subset of units, selected from a frame for the purpose of collecting information from those units. The inference about the population as a whole is drawn from the findings based on that sample.

#### Sampling unit

The unit of selection at each stage of the sampling process, each unit being regarded as individual and indivisible when the selection is made.

#### Primary sampling unit (PSU)

The sampling unit for the first stage of selection in a multi-stage sampling procedure, typically a geographically defined unit such as an enumeration area (EA) or a segment of an EA.

#### Secondary sampling unit (SSU)

A unit selected in the second stage of a multi-stage sampling process. The SSU is chosen within each selected Primary Sampling Unit (PSU).

#### Sample take

The number of ultimate units to be selected within each selected PSU.

#### Probability sample

A sample in which the units are selected randomly with known and nonzero probabilities.

#### Quick counting

A rapid, short-duration exercise to collect preliminary, indicative, or basic data such as measure of size.

#### Reliability (precision, margin of error)

Closeness of the initial estimated value to the subsequent estimated value.

#### Sampling frame

A complete list of all sampling units that entirely covers the target population and is used as a basis for sampling.

#### Frame data (items)

The attributes of units of which the frame is composed, enabling the relevant population for the survey to be identified and stratified for sampling purposes, the sample to be selected, and the observation units to be identified and contacted for data.

#### Sampling fraction

The ratio of sample size to the total number of population size/units.

#### Sample size

The number of sampling units selected or surveyed from the population.

#### Sampling error

Random error in survey estimate due to the fact that a sample rather than the entire population is surveyed; square root of sampling variance.

#### Standard error (SE)

The standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic, or representative error due to sampling.

#### Relative standard error (RSE)

The amount of sampling error relative to the indicator level, independent of the scale of the indicator, calculated by dividing the standard error by the estimated value of the indicator.

#### Multi-stage sampling

Process of selecting sampling units in stages with units at each stage being sub-sampled from the (larger) units chosen at the previous stage.

#### Sampling in phases

A sampling procedure in which the sample is selected in phases. In the first phase, a large sample is selected to obtain preliminary information, and in the second phase, a subsample of the initial sample is selected for more detailed information.

#### Design weight

The basic weight assigned to each unit in the sample, equal to the inverse of its probability of selection according to the survey design.

#### Sampling weight

The sampling weight (or survey weight) of a sampling unit is the design weight corrected for non-response or other calibrations like poststratification.

#### Poststratification

A statistical adjustment method applied to survey weights after data collection to align the survey estimates with known population totals for certain key variables (like age, sex, or region).

#### Self-weighting sample

A sample is self-weighting if every sampling unit has the same selection probability and hence the same sampling weight.

#### Sampling variance

The sampling variance of an estimate is the variance of the estimator over all possible samples that could be selected using the same sampling design.

#### Sampling with probability proportionate to size (PPS)

A sampling procedure in which the probability of selecting a sampling unit (such as an enumeration area, cluster, or establishment) is directly proportional to a known measure of its size (e.g., number of households, population, or employees), ensuring that each final element in the population has an equal chance of selection.

#### Self‑weighting Sample design

A sample design in which every unit in the target population has an equal probability of selection, resulting in identical design weights for all sampled units. This ensures that each unit represents the same number of units in the population, simplifying estimation and analysis by removing the need for unequal weighting adjustments.

#### Simple random sample (SRS)

A sample in which each unit of the population has the same probability of inclusion and each possible sample of a given size has the same probability of being selected.

#### Stratified sampling

A probability sampling method in which the population is divided into distinct subgroups, or strata, that are internally homogeneous with respect to certain characteristics but differ across strata. Independent samples are then drawn from each stratum according to specified allocation rules. This approach improves the precision of survey estimates and ensures adequate representation of key subpopulations.

#### Segmentation

A procedure used in multi-stage sampling designs where a selected primary sampling unit (such as an enumeration area or village) is subdivided into smaller, approximately equal parts called segments. One or more segments are then randomly selected for listing. Segmentation ensures manageable fieldwork and maintains equal selection probabilities within large sampling units.

#### Systematic sampling

A probability sampling method in which units are selected at regular intervals from an ordered sampling frame after the random selection of a starting point within the first interval.

#### Target population

The entire group of units about which survey information is required and to which the survey estimates are intended to apply. The target population should be clearly defined in terms of time, geography, and population characteristics to guide sampling design and ensure relevant, representative results.

#### Unit non-response

The situation in which a selected unit in the sample, such as a household, individual, or establishment, does not provide any usable information for the survey. Unit non-response can arise due to refusal, absence, or inability to contact the unit.

#### Item non-response

The type of nonresponse in which some questions, but not all, are answered for a particular sampling unit.

#### Household listing

A field-based activity in which all households and dwellings within a selected area, such as an enumeration area or segment, are systematically identified and recorded to create an up-to-date sampling frame for selecting the final sample units for a household survey.

#### Gross response rate

The number of respondents/units who complete a questionnaire divided the number of units in the sample, usually expressed as a percentage.

#### Net response rate

The number of respondents/units interviewed divided by the number eligible respondents/units for the survey.

#### Variance

A measure expressing the extent to which the values of a variable differ from the mean of the variable.

#### Cross-Sectional Survey

A type of survey that collects data on variables of interest at a single point in time, without following the same units over time. It provides a "snapshot" of the population's characteristics, behaviours, or conditions at that specific time.

#### Longitudinal (Panel) Survey

A survey in which data is collected on the variables of interest from the same sample repeatedly over a period of time in order to study the changes over time.

#### Sample Design
