It is used to compare the relative welfare or standard of living in different countries in a particular period.\n\n\n\nOutput that consists of goods or services that are produced within an establishment that become available for use outside that establishment, plus any goods and services produced for own final use.\n\n\n\nConsists of the value of the goods and services consumed as inputs by a process of production, excluding fixed assets whose consumption is recorded as consumption of fixed capital; the goods or services may be either transformed or used up by the production process.\n\n\n\nGVA is derived as the gross output less the intermediate consumption.\n\n\n\nThis is the total remuneration in cash or in kind paid to employees and comprises wages and salaries and the value of social contributions paid by employers.\n\n\n\nThe operating surplus measures the surplus or deficit accruing from production before taking account of any interest, rent or similar charges payable on financial or tangible non-produced assets borrowed or rented by the enterprise, or any interest, rent or similar receipts receivable on financial or tangible non-produced assets owned by the enterprise; (note: for unincorporated enterprises owned by households, this component is called “mixed income”).\n\n\n\nThe surplus or deficit accruing from production by unincorporated enterprises owned by households; it implicitly contains an element of remuneration for work done by the owner, or other members of the household, that cannot be separately identified from the return to the owner as entrepreneur, but it excludes the operating surplus coming from owner-occupied dwellings.\n\n\n\nTaxes other than those incurred directly as a result of engaging in production; they mainly consist of current taxes on the labour or capital employed in the enterprise, such as payroll taxes or current taxes on vehicles or buildings.\n\n\n\nThe amount receivable by the producer from the purchaser for a unit of a good or service produced as output minus any tax payable, and plus any subsidy receivable, on that unit as a consequence of its production or sale; it excludes any transport charges invoiced separately by the producer.\n\n\n\nThe amount paid by the purchaser, excluding any deductible VAT or similar deductible tax, in order to take delivery of a unit of a good or service at the time and place required by the purchaser; the purchaser’s price of a good includes any transport charges paid separately by the purchaser to take delivery at the required time and place.\n\n\n\nExpenditure, including imputed expenditure, incurred by the general government on both individual consumption goods and services and collective consumption services.\n\n\n\nThe sector consists of the totality of institutional units which, in addition to fulfilling their political responsibilities and their role of economic regulation, produce principally non-market services (possibly goods) for individual or collective consumption and redistribute income and wealth.\n\n\n\nExpenditure incurred by the resident households on final consumption of goods and services, whether made within or outside the economic territory.\n\n\n\nThe Private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) is defined as the expenditure incurred by the resident non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) on final consumption of goods and services, whether made within or outside the economic territory.\n\n\n\nThis is measured as the total value of a producer’s acquisitions, less disposals, of fixed assets during the accounting period plus certain additions to the value of non-produced assets realised by the productive activity of institutional units. Expenditure on mineral exploration and military ware not used purely for war purposes are included in GFCF. However, intangible assets, such as copyrights, computer software etc, are not included due to unavailability of reliable data.\n\n\n\nTangible or intangible assets produced as outputs from processes of production that are themselves used repeatedly or continuously in other processes of production for more than one year.\n\n\n\nConstitutes the decline in the value of the fixed assets owned by an enterprise, as a result of their physical deterioration and normal rates of obsolescence and accidental damage. In other words it is the wear and tear of an asset during the accounting period.\n\n\n\nChanges in inventories (including work-in-progress) consist of changes in :(a) stocks of outputs that are still held by the units that produced them prior to their being further processed, sold, delivered to other units or used in other ways; and(b) stocks of products acquired from other units that are intended to be used for intermediate consumption or for resale without further processing; they are measured by the value of the entries into inventories less the value of withdrawals and the value of any recurrent losses of goods held in inventories.\n\n\n\nThe production approach, which is also called the output approach, measures GDP as the difference between value of output less the value of goods and services used in producing these outputs during an accounting period\n\n\n\nGDP by expenditure approach also known as the aggregate demand is defined as private final consumption expenditure + government final consumption expenditure + gross capital formation + exports - imports.\n\n\n\nThe income approach estimates GDP as the sum of the incomes receivable by each institutional sector from the domestic production of goods and services.\n\n\n\nThe aggregate value of the gross balances of primary incomes for all sectors. GNI is the gross domestic product, plus net receipts from abroad of compensation of employees, property income and net taxes less subsidies on production.\n\n\n\nGross national disposable income may be derived from gross national income by adding all current transfers in cash or in kind receivable by resident institutional units from non-resident units and subtracting all current transfers in cash or in kind payable by resident institutional units to non-resident units.\n\n\n\nNet saving is net disposable income less final consumption expenditure.\n\n\n\nNet amount a unit or a sector has available to finance, directly or indirectly, other units or other sectors; it is the balancing item in the capital account and is defined as: (Net saving plus capital transfers receivable minus capital transfers payable) minus (the value of acquisitions less disposals of non-financial assets, less consumption of fixed capital); negative net lending may also be described as “net borrowing”.\n\n\n\nThis is the difference between GDP compiled by the various approaches, e.g. the difference between GDP by production approach and GDP by expenditure approach.\n\n\n\nThe Supply Table describes how goods and services become available in an economy during a certain period of time. Products are either produced in the domestic industry or imported. The Use Table shows how goods and services are used in the economy during a certain period of time.\n\n\n\nAn input-output table is a means of presenting a detailed analysis of the process of production and the use of goods and services (products) and the income generated in that production.; they can be either in the form of (a) supply and use tables or (b) symmetric input-output tables.\n\n\n\nA means of presenting the SNA accounts in a matrix which elaborates the linkages between a supply and use table and institutional sector accounts; a typical focus of a SAM on the role of people in the economy may be reflected by, among other things, extra breakdowns of the household sector and a disaggregated representation of labour markets (i.e., distinguishing various categories of employed persons).\n\n\n\nSatellite accounts provide a framework linked to the central accounts and which enables attention to be focussed on a certain field or aspect of economic and social life in the context of national accounts; common examples are satellite accounts for the environment, or tourism, or unpaid household work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA systematic statistical statement that summarizes for a given period (e.g. calendar year), an economy’s transactions with the rest of the world. BOP captures transactions between residents and nonresidents, irrespective of the currency in which the transaction is made. BOP comprises the Current Account (Goods and Services; Primary Income; and Secondary Income) and the Capital and Financial Accounts.\n\n\n\nThe current account focuses on transactions related to the exchange of goods, services, income, and current transfers. It consists of Goods, Services, Primary Income and Secondary Income sub-accounts.\n\n\n\nIncludes the export and import of physical goods (merchandise). It also includes trade in goods by a resident and subsequent resale of these goods without them being physically present in the country. This concept is referred to as merchanting.\n\n\n\nIt covers the export and import of services. These are categorized into twelve broad categories in the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition (BPM6) as follows; Manufacturing of Physical Inputs owned by Others; Maintenance and Repair Services; Transport; Travel; Construction; Insurance and Pension Services; Financial Services; Charges for the use of intellectual property n.i.e; Telecommunications, Computer and Information Services; Other Business Services (including Trade, Technical and related services,Research and development services, professional and management consulting services, waste treatment and depollution, agricultural and mining services, operating leasing, Trade related services ; Personal, cultural and recreation services; and Government goods and services n.i.e\n\n\n\nPrimary income captures returns for the provision of labor and financial assets; and renting of natural resources between resident and non-resident entities. This account records compensation of employees, income from investments such as dividends, interest, reinvested earnings; investment income attributable to policyholders in insurance, standardized guarantees, and pension funds; and rent.\n\n\n\nThis account records transfers of money or value between residents and non-residents, where no goods or services are exchanged. This includes:\n· Personal transfers: All current transfers in cash or in kind made or received by resident households to or from nonresident households. They include remittances sent by workers to their families in their home countries.\n· Other current transfers: These include Social contributions, social benefits,net premiums and claims on non-life insurance, Contributions from foreign governments, charitable donations, and other financial transfers, including aid and gifts.\n\n\n\nThe current account balance is the sum of the balances of the four sub-accounts:\nCurrent Account Balance (CAB) = Balance of the Goods Account + Services Account Balance + Balance in the Primary Income Account + Balance in the Secondary Income Account\n\n\n\nA current account surplus occurs when a country earns more income from abroad than it spends i.e. the CAB is a positive value. On the other hand, a current account deficit results from greater expenditure on goods produced or services rendered by non-residents as well as increased payments on factors of production, including interest and labour.\n\n\n\nThis account shows (a) capital transfers receivable and payable between residents and nonresidents and (b) the acquisition and disposal of non-produced, nonfinancial assets between residents and nonresidents.\nCapital transfers are transfers in which the ownership of an asset (other than cash or inventories) changes from one party to another; or which obliges one or both parties to acquire or dispose of an asset (other than cash or inventories); or where a liability is forgiven by the creditor. This include debt forgiveness, investment grants, one-off guarantees and debt assumption, large gifts and inheritances (legacies), including those to nonprofit institutions; cash grants from donor governments or multilateral financial institutions to the debtor economy to be used to repay debt\nNon-produced, non-financial assets consist of natural resources, contracts, leases and licenses; and marketing assets (including goodwill).\n\n\n\nThis account records transactions that involve financial assets and liabilities that take place between residents and nonresidents. It tracks cross-border investments and transactions that change the ownership of financial assets and liabilities. The financial account indicates the functional categories, sectors, instruments and maturities used for net international financing transactions. Entries in the financial account can be corresponding entries to goods, services, income, capital account, or other financial account entries. The financial account shows net acquisition of financial assets and net incurrence of liabilities. There are five functional categories in the Financial Account which include Direct Investment, Portfolio Investment, Other Investment, Financial Derivatives and Reserve Assets.\n\n\n\nThis arises when an entity, resident in one economy has equity shareholding or equivalent voting rights of 10% per cent or more in an entity resident in another economy that gives rise to a significant degree of influence or control in the management of this non-resident entity. A significant degree of influence exists when the non-resident Direct Investor has shareholding or equivalent voting rights of between 10 to 50 per cent of the value resident entity while control exists when the shareholding is more than 50 per cent.\nEnterprises in a direct investment relationship with each other are called affiliates or affiliated enterprises. In addition, all enterprises that are under the control or influence of the same direct investor are considered to be in a direct investment relationship with each other.\n\n\n\nThis is defined as cross border transactions and positions involving debt or equity securities, other than those included in direct investment or reserve assets. Investments by a non-resident in an economy in form of shares/voting rights of less than 10% (equity securities) and/or investment in financial instruments which are tradable (debt/non-equity securities). The negotiability of securities is a way of facilitating trading, allowing them to be held by different parties during their lives.\nPortfolio investment covers, but is not limited to, securities traded on organized or other financial markets and usually involves financial infrastructure, such as a suitable legal, regulatory, and settlement framework, along with market-making dealers, and a sufficient volume of buyers and sellers. Transactions in listed equity in the Securities markets or organized exchanges constitute Portfolio Investment.\n\n\n\nThis captures any other investment by a non-resident in an economy that cannot be classified either as Direct Investment, Portfolio Investment, financial derivatives and employee stock options; and reserve assets. This comprises other equity (less than 10% of voting rights and non-tradable); currency and deposits; loans (including the use of IMF credit and loans from the IMF); trade credits and advances; insurance, pension and standardized guarantee schemes; accounts payable and receivable; and SDR allocations.\nOther investments may be split by financial asset or liability class, original or remaining maturity, or institutional sector.\n\n\n\nReserve assets are those external assets that are readily available to and controlled by monetary authorities for meeting balance of payments financing needs, for intervention in exchange markets to affect the currency exchange rate, and for other related purposes (such as maintaining confidence in the currency and the economy; and serving as a basis for foreign borrowing). This includes central bank holdings of foreign exchange reserves, monetary gold, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) holdings, Reserve Position in the Fund and debt securities .\n\n\n\nInternational Investment Position (IIP) is a statistical statement that shows at a point in time the value and composition of financial assets of residents of an economy that are claims on nonresidents and gold bullion held as reserve assets; and liabilities of residents of an economy to non residents. The key components of IIP are similar to the components of the Financial Account of the Balance of Payments and include Direct Investment Assets/Liabilities, Portfolio Investment Assets/Liabilities, Other Investment Assets/Liabilities, Financial derivatives and Reserve Assets.\nThe difference between an economy’s external financial assets and liabilities is the economy’s net IIP, which may be positive or negative.\n\n\n\nThese are financial claims by residents of a country on non-residents/rest of the world. The existence of the counterpart liability distinguishes financial assets from other economic assets, such as land, dwellings, machinery, equipment, etc.\n\n\n\nFinancial liabilities are financial claims on residents by non-residents/rest of the world.\n\n\n\nConsists of all non-resident institutional units that enter into transactions with resident units, or have other economic links with resident units.\n\n\n\nA resident is an individual, entity or organization located in an economic territory, with which it has the centre of predominant economic interest. An enterprise incorporated in Kenya is considered a resident of Kenya irrespective of the location of the owners of the enterprise. A branch of a foreign enterprise operating (or intending to operate) in Kenya for more than a year is treated as a resident of Kenya. A household is resident in the economic territory in which household members maintain or intend to maintain a dwelling or succession of dwellings treated and used by members of the household as their principal dwelling. If an individual is present in a territory for one year or more or intending to do so is sufficient to qualify as having a principal dwelling there. If there is uncertainty about the principal dwelling, the length of time spent there should inform whether they are resident or not.\nA legal entity is resident in the economic territory under whose laws the entity is incorporated or registered. If there is no incorporation or registration, legal domicile is used to ascertain the residence of the entity.\nA Non Profit Institutions Serving Households (NPISH) has a center of economic interest in the economy in which the institution was legally created and is officially recognized and recorded as a legal or social entity. When an NPISH is engaged in charity or relief work on an international scale, it may maintain substantial operations for individual territories that may amount to branches.\nAn exception to this rule includes the following:\n\n  Diplomats of Foreign Governments, Embassies, Military bases of foreign governments, cross-border workers, Patients and Students who are residents of their economies.\nInternational/multilateral organizations who are not residents of any Government e.g. World Bank Group, International Monetary Fund. International organizations are resident in an economic territory of their own, and not of the economy in which they are physically located. Some international organizations cover a group of economies in a particular region, such as with economic or currency unions. If statistics are prepared for that region as a whole, these regional organizations are residents of the region as a whole, even though they are not residents of any member economy.\n\n\n\n\nA transaction is an interaction between two institutional units that occurs by mutual agreement or through the operation of the law and involves an exchange of value or a transfer. Transactions are classified according to the nature of the economic value provided—namely, goods or services, primary income, secondary income, capital transfers, nonproduced non-financial assets, financial assets, or liabilities. Transactions recorded in the BOP. are interactions between a resident and a nonresident institutional unit.\n\n\n\nStock of financial assets and liabilities at a specific point in time and are recorded in the IIP.\n\n\n\nThese are financial contracts made between institutional units and can be broadly divided into:\n· Equity and Investment Fund shares: These include shares and other forms of ownership in an enterprise.\n· Non-Equity/Debt Instruments: These include currency and deposits, debt securities, loans, trade credits and advances; other accounts receivables/payables, insurance, pension and standardized guarantee schemes, financial derivatives and employee stock options are also included in other financial instruments.\n\n\n\nIncome on equity not paid out to investors as dividends but retained in the enterprise (e.g., retained profits).\n\n\n\nChanges in the value of assets due to price changes and reflect nominal hold- ing gains and losses on environmental assets. The nominal holding gain for environmental assets is calculated in the same way as for non-financial assets, as the increase in value accruing to the owner of the asset as a result of a change in its price over a period of time. Holding gains and losses are realized when the asset is sold or liability extinguished. Holding gains and losses on unsold assets and unpaid liabilities are unrealized but are recorded as revaluations.\n\n\n\nSDRs are an international reserve asset created by the IMF, used to supplement its member countries’ official reserves. SDR holdings represent unconditional rights to obtain foreign exchange or other reserve assets from other IMF members. SDR holdings are classified as reserve assets in while SDR allocations are captured in Other Investments liabilities.\n\n\n\nValuation principles for measuring cross-border transactions and positions are market prices or book values for assets and liabilities.\n\n\n\nAccrual accounting records flows at the time economic value is created, transformed, exchanged, transferred, or extinguished. This means that flows that imply a change of economic ownership are recorded when ownership passes and services are recorded when provided, irrespective of whether cash was received or paid or was due to be received or paid.\n\n\n\nMarket prices for transactions are defined as amounts of money that willing buyers pay to acquire something from willing sellers; the exchanges are made between independent parties and on the basis of commercial considerations only—sometimes called “at arm’s length”. Transactions in loans, deposits, and other accounts receivable/ payable also should be valued at market prices. Transactions in financial assets and liabilities should be recorded exclusive of any commissions, fees, and taxes whether charged explicitly, included in the purchaser’s price, or deducted from the seller’s proceeds. When market prices for transactions are not observable, valuation according to market-equivalent prices provides approximation to market prices. In such cases, market prices of the same or similar items when such prices exist will provide a good basis for applying the principle of market prices.\n\n\n\nThe value recorded in the enterprises records.\n\n\n\nThe outstanding amount the debtor owes to the creditor, which is composed of the outstanding principal amount including any accrued interest. Therefore, the nominal value reflects the sum of funds originally advanced, plus any subsequent advances, plus any interest that has accrued, less any repayments (which includes any payments covering interest accrual). If a debt instrument is denominated in foreign currency, the corresponding nominal value of the instrument in domestic currency also includes holding gains or losses arising from exchange rate changes.\n\n\n\nThe amortized value of a loan reflects the process of gradual elimination of the liability by regular payments over a specified period of time. On the date of each scheduled payment, amortized value is the same as nominal value, but it may differ from the nominal value on other dates because nominal value includes interest that has accrued and not been paid.\n\n\n\nThe undiscounted amount to be paid to the holder at maturity. It is also known as “par value” or simply “par.” Before maturity, the market value of a bond may be greater or lesser than the face value, depending on the interest rate payable and the perceived risk of default. As bonds approach maturity, market value approaches face value. For example, if interest rates are higher than the bond’s coupon rate, then the bond is sold at a discount (below par). Conversely, if interest rates are lower than the bond’s coupon rate, then the bond is sold at a premium (above par).\n\n\n\nIn practice, data may not perfectly match due to various statistical discrepancies, either from source data or from compilation. This gives rise to net errors and omissions. While net errors and omissions is a residual item, the size and trends may help identify data problems, such as coverage or misreporting. Patterns in net errors and omissions may provide useful information on data problems. While it is not possible to have guidelines on an acceptable size for net errors and omissions, it can be assessed in relation to other items, such as GDP, current account balance, positions data, and gross flows.\n\n\n\nBPM6 provides guidance for compilation of BOP and IIP by attributing institutional units to the following sectors:\n● Central Bank\n○ Deposit taking Corporations except the Central Bank\n○ General government\n● Other Sectors\n■ Other financial corporations\n● Moneymarketfunds(MMFs)\n● Non-MMF Investment funds\n● Other financial intermediaries except insurance corporations and pension funds (ICPFs)\n● Financial auxiliaries\n● Captive financial institutions and money lenders\n● Insurance corporations\n● Pension funds\n■ Non-financial corporations, households, and NPISHs\n● Nonfinancial corporations\n● Households\n● NPISHs (non-profit institutions serving households; maybe combined with households)\nThe full institutional sector detail is required for international accounts to be fully integrated with monetary, flow of funds, and other financial data.\n\n\n\nBrings together financial arrangements made by the authorities (or by other sectors fostered by authorities) of an economy to meet Balance of Payments needs. Arrears related to exceptional financing are recorded below the line as transactions in the analytical presentation of the Balance of Payments with the corresponding entry in the relevant instrument.\n\n\n\nThis is a data collection system that obtains data from banks and companies at the level of individual transactions. An ideal ITRS measures: (1) cash transactions with nonresidents that pass through domestic banks; (2) cash transactions that pass-through enterprise accounts with banks abroad; (3) transactions on intercompany accounts with nonresident companies; (4) positions; and (5) noncash transactions.\nStatistics are compiled from forms submitted to/by domestic banks and from forms submitted by companies.\nHowever, the efficacy of the ITRS is based on the legal framework, accounting systems, and foreign exchange regulations of various economies. In Kenya, the ITRS is a major data source on cross border transactions. However, it is not sufficient to address all the BOP requirements hence the use of complimentary data sources, including surveys to enterprises.\n\n\n\nThe Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition (BPM6) is a comprehensive set of guidelines published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It provides standards for compiling and presenting Balance of Payments (BOP) and International Investment Positions (IIP).\n\n\n\n\nCovers statistical activities on the general government sector and the broader public sector. It covers the compilation of data on revenues, expenditures, transactions in financial assets and liabilities, and balance sheet data.\n\n\nClassification of the government outlays by functions, or socio-economic objectives, that general government units aim to achieve through the outlays.\n\n\n\nClassification of government outlays used to identify the types of expense incurred when a government supplies goods and services to the community or redistributes income and wealth.\n\n\n\nA transaction involving exchange and transfer that reduces the net worth of the government.\n\n\n\nA set of exchange and transfer transactions that increase the net worth of the government.\n\n\n\nThe expense involving total remuneration, in cash or in kind, payable to a government employee in return for work done during the accounting period, except for work connected to own-account capital formation\n\n\n\nAn expense that involves purchase of goods and services for production of market and nonmarket goods and services Plus goods purchased for resale Minus the change in inventories of materials, work-in- progress, finished goods, and goods held for resale. The value is recorded when goods or services are actually used rather than when they were acquired\n\n\n\nThe expense that a government unit (debtor) incurs for use of the principal outstanding, which is the economic value that has been provided by the creditor. Interest accrues continuously over period that the liability exists\n\n\n\nCurrent transfers that government units pay to enterprises either on the basis of the levels of their production activities or on the basis of the quantities or values of the goods or services that they produce, sell, or import.\n\n\n\nSocial benefits represent the government’s financial contributions to support its citizens’ welfare. They are typically non-market transfers (e.g., financial aid) aimed at improving economic security.\n\n\n\nCurrent transfers are voluntary transfers from the central government to other levels of government for the purpose their current expenditure\n\n\n\nCapital transfers are voluntary transfers from the central government to other levels of government for the purpose of their capital expenditure\n\n\n\nTransactions involving a monetary exchange for produced and non-produced fixed assets, inventories, valuables; most nonfinancial assets provide benefits either through their use in the production of goods and services or in the form of property income.\n\n\n\nThese are transactions that entail the government to a financial claim from a second unit; the financial assets include participation of equity, monetary gold, and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) allocated by the IMF.\n\n\n\nTotal outlays during an accounting period towards principal repayment thus reducing the liabilities for the government\n\n\n\nTaxes are compulsory unrequited transfers to the general government sector from resident households and enterprises.\n\n\n\nA consumption tax levied at each stage of production of goods and services based on the value added to the product at that stage.\n\n\n\nTax levied on specific goods and commodities produced or sold within the country. The level of duty is dependent upon the Government policy to raise revenue, protect industries or discourage consumption.\n\n\n\nA levy imposed on imported goods.\n\n\n\nCertain compulsory transfers, such as fines, penalties, and most social security contributions.\n\n\n\nVoluntary unrequited transfers received/paid by government units from/to other government units or international organizations.\n\n\n\nThe total stock of liabilities that the Government owes to residents.\n\n\n\nThe total stock of liabilities that the Government owes to non-residents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovers the stock and flow of the financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities of an economy’s financial corporations sector.\n\n\n\nCovers the stock and flow of the financial assets and liabilities of all sectors of an economy.\n\n\n\nGross foreign assets less gross foreign liabilities of depository corporations\n\n\n\nCredit advanced by Depository Corporations to resident institutions and individuals\n\n\n\nA commercial bank is the most common designation of a deposit-taking corporation but use of the term “bank” in the name of an entity does not imply it is actually a commercial bank. It should be classified as a bank based on the types of activities undertaken and not based on the name alone. The most common services provided by commercial banks are accepting deposits and granting loans or other forms of finance to corporations and households.\n\n\n\nInstitutions providing financial services mainly credit, savings, insurance etc. to those sectors of the economy considered risky by commercial banks. Their target market is typically poor households and micro and small enterprises.\nThey can be classified into:\n\n    Microfinance banks\n    Non-deposit Microfinance\n    Digital Credit Providers\n\n\n\n\nThe ability to sell assets quickly and in large volume without substantially affecting their price. A financial asset is liquid if, at short notice and minimum cost, it can be bought, sold, redeemed at, or close to, full value. This means that to be liquid, a financial asset must be exchangeable against a medium of exchange with minimum cost and time, and without unduly affecting the value of the asset.\n\n\n\nAll funds received or held by the reporting institution on behalf of third parties that are represented by evidence of deposit. This item covers the reporting institution’s deposit liabilities of all maturities with credit balances\n\n\n\nFunds borrowed by the institutions and individuals from institutional units/sectors which are evidenced by on-negotiable documents, including credit cards.\n\n\n\nA loan is non-performing when payments of interest or principal are past due by 90 days or more. However, the period by which institutions classify a loan as non performing may vary.\n\n\n\nThe main categories of money are:\n\n**M0** Currency outside the banking system excluding commemorative coins\n**M1** M0 + demand deposits of banks (or depository corporations) plus other deposits at CBK\n **Quasi Money** comprises of call plus 7 days deposits, savings and time deposits.\n**Broad Money (M2)** M1 + Quasi (long term) money deposits (time and savings deposits of banks). This was previously M3. The previous M2 was this aggregate less both quasi-money deposits in non- bank financial institutions and their holding of cash in till and any deposits they hold in other banks.\n**Extended Broad Money (M3)** M2 + resident foreign currency deposits.\n  **Overall Liquidity** M3 + non-bank holdings of Government securities\n\n\n\n\nDeposits which are subject to transfer by cashing out or cheques. Demand deposits consist of deposits (in local and foreign currency) which are immediately convertible into cash and which are transferable by cheque, banker’s order, debit entry etc, without significant restriction or penalty.\n\n\n\nDeposits which are usually not subject to transfer by cheque and are lodged for a definite period, subject to advance notice of withdrawal.\n\n\n\nDeposits lodged for no fixed period. Certain conditions are applicable to depositors who wish to avail cheque facilities.\n\n\n\nDeposit taking financial corporations have financial intermediation as their principal activity. They obtain funds through the acceptance of deposits or other financial instruments such as short-term certificates of deposits\n\n\n\nThe first of four accounts dealing with changes in the values of assets held by institutional units. It records the values of the non-financial assets that are acquired, or disposed of, by resident institutional units by engaging in transactions and to show the change in net worth due to saving and capital transfers.\n\n\n\nA payment system where both processing and final settlement of funds transfer instructions take place continuously (i.e. in real time) from one bank to another.\n\n\n\nThe rate of interest Central Bank charges on loans to banks.\n\n\n\nThe interest paid by the Central Bank to Commercial Banks for lending money in the repo market. Repurchase Agreements (Repo) are conducted whenever the Central Bank is mopping up excess liquidity from the domestic market. A Repo is a collateralized loan involving a contractual arrangement between two parties, whereby one party sells a security at a specified price with a commitment to buy back the same at a later date.\n\n\n\nThe rate of interest charged on short-term loans between banks. Banks borrow and lend money in the interbank lending market in order to manage liquidity and satisfy regulations such as reserve requirements.\n\n\n\nOverdraft is a financial instrument to provide an extension of credit when the current account balance reaches zero.\n\n\n\nThis is the difference between the Loans and Advances interest rate and the Average Deposits rate.\n\n\n\nLending interest rate adjusted for inflation\n\n\n\nThis is a financial market for companies seeking to raise equity capital. It offers a liquid market for issuers enabling them to access a wide range of domestic and international retail and institutional investors.\n\n\n\nLong term insurance business comprises life assurance, annuities, deposit administration, group life, group credit, investments, personal pensions and permanent health.\n\n\n\nThis is a short term or annual insurance arrangement and can be broadly categorized into two; Personal (for individuals) and commercial (for commercial entities). General insurance in Kenya is categorized into the following distinct classes: Aviation Insurance, Engineering, Home (Fire Domestic), Fire Industrial, Public Liability, Marine insurance, Motor Private/Commercial, Personal Accident, Theft, Work Injury Benefits (WIBA), Medical, Micro and Miscellaneous Insurance.\n\n\n\nThe amount of money received by an insurance firm which is as a result of money paid by the policyholder to the insurance company for coverage.\n\n\n\nA formal request by the policyholder to the insurance company for payment or reimbursement for a covered loss or policy event.\n\n\n\nThe process by which a direct-writing life insurance company transfers part of its risk under a contract to another life insurance company. This may be another direct-writing company or a professional reinsurance company.\n\n\n\n\nThe System of Environmental-Economic Accounting (SEEA) is a framework that integrates economic and environmental data to provide a more comprehensive and multipurpose view of the interrelationships between the economy and the environment and the stocks and changes in stocks of environmental assets, as they bring benefits to humanity.

Electricity can be generated through different processes such as the conversion of energy contained in falling or streaming water, wind or waves; the direct conversion of solar radiation through photovoltaic processes in semiconductor devices (solar cells); or by the combustion of fuels.\nIn Kenya, electric power is mainly generated from renewable sources like Geothermal, solar and wind and/or non-renewable sources including thermal sources.\n\n\n\nThese are units that produce electricity or heat as their principal activity. Formerly known as public utilities, these enterprises may be privately or publicly owned companies.\n\n\n\nThese are units that produce electricity, but for which the production is not their principal activity.\n\n\n\nThese are units that produce heat for sale, but for which the production is not their principal activity. Deliveries of fuels for heat generated by a unit for its own purposes are classified as final consumption, and not as transformation inputs.\n\n\n\nPlants producing only electricity. The electricity may be obtained directly from natural sources such as hydro, geothermal, wind, tidal, marine, solar energy or from fuel cells, or from the heat obtained from the combustion of fuels or nuclear reactions.\n\n\n\nPlants that produce both heat and electricity from at least one generating unit in the plant. They are sometimes referred to as “co-generation” plants.\n\n\n\nPlants (including heat pumps and electric boilers) designed to produce heat only for deliveries to third parties. Deliveries of fuels for heat generated by an autoproducer for its own purposes are classified as final consumption.\n\n\n\nElectricity produced from solar photovoltaics,i.e. by the direct conversion of solar radiation through photovoltaic processes in semiconductor devices (solar cells), including concentrating photovoltaic systems.\n\n\n\nElectricity produced from solar heat (both concentrating and non-concentrating).\n\n\n\nElectricity produced from devices driven by wind.\n\n\n\nElectricity produced from devices driven by fresh, flowing or falling water.\n\n\n\nElectricity produced from devices driven by the motion of waves.\n\n\n\nElectricity generated from devices driven by tidal currents or the differences of water level caused by tides.\n\n\n\nElectricity generated from devices that exploit sources of marine energy not elsewhere specified. Examples of such sources are non-tidal currents, temperature differences and salinity gradients in seas or salinity differences between sea and fresh water.\n\n\n\nElectricity generated from the heat from geothermal sources.\n\n\n\nElectricity generated by nuclear heat.\n\n\n\nElectricity generated from heat recovered from a non-combusting chemical reaction.\n\n\n\nElectricity produced from sources not elsewhere specified (including fuel cells).\n\n\n\nThe generation of heat from solar thermal (concentrating and non-concentrating). Heat from concentrating solar thermal refers to high temperature heat produced from solar radiation captured by concentrating solar thermal systems.\nThe high temperature heat can be transformed to generate electricity, drive chemical reactions, or be used directly in industrial processes. Heat from non-concentrating solar thermal refers to low temperature heat produced from solar radiation captured by non-concentrating solar thermal systems. The heat can be used for applications, such as space heating, cooling, water heating, district heating and industrial processes.\n\n\n\nIn energy statistics, energy consumers consist of economic units (enterprises and households) that act as final users of energy; they use energy products for energy purposes (heat raising, transportation and electrical services) and/or for non-energy purposes. It should be noted that the economic units belonging to the energy industries that use energy to produce other energy products are excluded from this group. Their energy use, by convention, is not part of the final consumption of energy and is considered separately as energy industries own use\n\n\n\nEnergy transmission refers to the process of transporting electrical energy, typically at high voltages, from power generation sources to substations, and then onward to distribution networks. It’s a crucial part of the electrical power grid, ensuring that electricity generated at power plants can be delivered to where it is needed.\n\n\n\nThe process of delivering energy, primarily electricity, from generation sources to end-users\n[Note: The energy section continues with many more detailed definitions about energy production, transformation, trade, and consumption that would be included in the full chapter]\n\n\n\n\n[Definitions for mining, manufacturing and construction sectors would be included here]\n\n\n\n\n\nMovement of people, animals, and goods from one location to the other using modes of transport such as air, rail, road, water and pipeline.\n\n\n\nMovement of people from one location to the other using modes of transport such as air, rail, road, water and pipeline.\n\n\n\nAny person who makes a journey including infants in arms but excluding on-duty crew.\n\n\n\nAny property carried in a transport mode other than passenger baggage.\n\n\n\nPersonal property of passengers and crew loaded or carried on board an aircraft by agreement with the operator.\n\n\n\nMeans travelling to and from one’s daily work.\n\n\n\nThe conveyance of people for reward (fare) by any travel mode e.g. by car, metered taxi, matatu, bus, rail, etc.\n\n\n\nAn area of land (including any buildings, installations and equipment) for use either wholly or in part for the arrival and departure of vehicles, or trains.\n\n\n\nMovements by vehicles, aircraft, ships, passengers, freight or mail, departing or arriving at airports, stations, ports, and parks.\n\n\n\nThe application of engineering measures such as traffic calming and/or road marking, road signs and traffic signals to regulate the use of road space and the speed and flow of traffic.\n[Note: The transport section continues with many more detailed definitions for air transport, railway transport, road transport, pipeline transport, sea transport, and inland waterway transport]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe activities of persons travelling to and staying in places outside their usual environment, for less than a year, for any main purpose, including business, leisure or other personal purpose, whose main purpose of trip is not the exercise of an activity remunerated from within the place visited.\n[Note: The tourism section continues with detailed definitions about visitors, tourists, accommodation, and tourism expenditure]\n\n\n\n\n\n[This section would include definitions related to banking services, insurance products, and financial markets]\n\n\n\n\n\nThis comprises all resident entities recognized as statistical units and classified in section G according to International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC Rev 4) irrespective of their size, form of economic and legal organization and ownership.

    "text": "The internationally agreed standard set of recommendations on how to compile measures of economic activity. It is a comprehensive, consistent and flexible set of macroeconomic accounts to meet the needs of government and private-sector analysts, policymakers, and decision-takers.\n\n\n\nThe total value of goods and services produced by resident producer units of a country for a specified period of time, usually one year. It is the sum of gross value added of all resident producer units (institutional sectors or industries).\n\n\n\nThe sum total of the gross values added of all resident producers at producers’ prices, less subsidies on imports, plus all non-deductible Value Added Taxes (VAT) (or similar taxes).\n\n\n\nThe total value of goods and services valued at prices of the particular year of reporting. This is also referred to as nominal GDP.\n\n\n\nThe year used as the base period for compilation of constant price estimates. The base year is reflected to be normal i.e. a year without major shocks or structural changes. The base year of the national accounts is chosen to allow for year-to-year comparisons.\n\n\n\nThe total value of goods and services for a particular period based on prices of a pre-determined base year.\n\n\n\nThe average production per person of goods and services for a specified period e.g. one year. It is used to compare the relative welfare or standard of living in different countries in a particular period.\n\n\n\nOutput that consists of goods or services that are produced within an establishment that become available for use outside that establishment, plus any goods and services produced for own final use.\n\n\n\nConsists of the value of the goods and services consumed as inputs by a process of production, excluding fixed assets whose consumption is recorded as consumption of fixed capital; the goods or services may be either transformed or used up by the production process.\n\n\n\nGVA is derived as the gross output less the intermediate consumption.\n\n\n\nThis is the total remuneration in cash or in kind paid to employees and comprises wages and salaries and the value of social contributions paid by employers.\n\n\n\nThe operating surplus measures the surplus or deficit accruing from production before taking account of any interest, rent or similar charges payable on financial or tangible non-produced assets borrowed or rented by the enterprise, or any interest, rent or similar receipts receivable on financial or tangible non-produced assets owned by the enterprise; (note: for unincorporated enterprises owned by households, this component is called “mixed income”).\n\n\n\nThe surplus or deficit accruing from production by unincorporated enterprises owned by households; it implicitly contains an element of remuneration for work done by the owner, or other members of the household, that cannot be separately identified from the return to the owner as entrepreneur, but it excludes the operating surplus coming from owner-occupied dwellings.\n\n\n\nTaxes other than those incurred directly as a result of engaging in production; they mainly consist of current taxes on the labour or capital employed in the enterprise, such as payroll taxes or current taxes on vehicles or buildings.\n\n\n\nThe amount receivable by the producer from the purchaser for a unit of a good or service produced as output minus any tax payable, and plus any subsidy receivable, on that unit as a consequence of its production or sale; it excludes any transport charges invoiced separately by the producer.\n\n\n\nThe amount paid by the purchaser, excluding any deductible VAT or similar deductible tax, in order to take delivery of a unit of a good or service at the time and place required by the purchaser; the purchaser’s price of a good includes any transport charges paid separately by the purchaser to take delivery at the required time and place.\n\n\n\nExpenditure, including imputed expenditure, incurred by the general government on both individual consumption goods and services and collective consumption services.\n\n\n\nThe sector consists of the totality of institutional units which, in addition to fulfilling their political responsibilities and their role of economic regulation, produce principally non-market services (possibly goods) for individual or collective consumption and redistribute income and wealth.\n\n\n\nExpenditure incurred by the resident households on final consumption of goods and services, whether made within or outside the economic territory.\n\n\n\nThe Private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) is defined as the expenditure incurred by the resident non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) on final consumption of goods and services, whether made within or outside the economic territory.\n\n\n\nThis is measured as the total value of a producer’s acquisitions, less disposals, of fixed assets during the accounting period plus certain additions to the value of non-produced assets realised by the productive activity of institutional units. Expenditure on mineral exploration and military ware not used purely for war purposes are included in GFCF. However, intangible assets, such as copyrights, computer software etc, are not included due to unavailability of reliable data.\n\n\n\nTangible or intangible assets produced as outputs from processes of production that are themselves used repeatedly or continuously in other processes of production for more than one year.\n\n\n\nConstitutes the decline in the value of the fixed assets owned by an enterprise, as a result of their physical deterioration and normal rates of obsolescence and accidental damage. In other words it is the wear and tear of an asset during the accounting period.\n\n\n\nChanges in inventories (including work-in-progress) consist of changes in :(a) stocks of outputs that are still held by the units that produced them prior to their being further processed, sold, delivered to other units or used in other ways; and(b) stocks of products acquired from other units that are intended to be used for intermediate consumption or for resale without further processing; they are measured by the value of the entries into inventories less the value of withdrawals and the value of any recurrent losses of goods held in inventories.\n\n\n\nThe production approach, which is also called the output approach, measures GDP as the difference between value of output less the value of goods and services used in producing these outputs during an accounting period\n\n\n\nGDP by expenditure approach also known as the aggregate demand is defined as private final consumption expenditure + government final consumption expenditure + gross capital formation + exports - imports.\n\n\n\nThe income approach estimates GDP as the sum of the incomes receivable by each institutional sector from the domestic production of goods and services.\n\n\n\nThe aggregate value of the gross balances of primary incomes for all sectors. GNI is the gross domestic product, plus net receipts from abroad of compensation of employees, property income and net taxes less subsidies on production.\n\n\n\nGross national disposable income may be derived from gross national income by adding all current transfers in cash or in kind receivable by resident institutional units from non-resident units and subtracting all current transfers in cash or in kind payable by resident institutional units to non-resident units.\n\n\n\nNet saving is net disposable income less final consumption expenditure.\n\n\n\nNet amount a unit or a sector has available to finance, directly or indirectly, other units or other sectors; it is the balancing item in the capital account and is defined as: (Net saving plus capital transfers receivable minus capital transfers payable) minus (the value of acquisitions less disposals of non-financial assets, less consumption of fixed capital); negative net lending may also be described as “net borrowing”.\n\n\n\nThis is the difference between GDP compiled by the various approaches, e.g. the difference between GDP by production approach and GDP by expenditure approach.\n\n\n\nThe Supply Table describes how goods and services become available in an economy during a certain period of time. Products are either produced in the domestic industry or imported. The Use Table shows how goods and services are used in the economy during a certain period of time.\n\n\n\nAn input-output table is a means of presenting a detailed analysis of the process of production and the use of goods and services (products) and the income generated in that production.; they can be either in the form of (a) supply and use tables or (b) symmetric input-output tables.\n\n\n\nA means of presenting the SNA accounts in a matrix which elaborates the linkages between a supply and use table and institutional sector accounts; a typical focus of a SAM on the role of people in the economy may be reflected by, among other things, extra breakdowns of the household sector and a disaggregated representation of labour markets (i.e., distinguishing various categories of employed persons).\n\n\n\nSatellite accounts provide a framework linked to the central accounts and which enables attention to be focussed on a certain field or aspect of economic and social life in the context of national accounts; common examples are satellite accounts for the environment, or tourism, or unpaid household work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA systematic statistical statement that summarizes for a given period (e.g. calendar year), an economy’s transactions with the rest of the world. BOP captures transactions between residents and nonresidents, irrespective of the currency in which the transaction is made. BOP comprises the Current Account (Goods and Services; Primary Income; and Secondary Income) and the Capital and Financial Accounts.\n\n\n\nThe current account focuses on transactions related to the exchange of goods, services, income, and current transfers. It consists of Goods, Services, Primary Income and Secondary Income sub-accounts.\n\n\n\nIncludes the export and import of physical goods (merchandise). It also includes trade in goods by a resident and subsequent resale of these goods without them being physically present in the country. This concept is referred to as merchanting.\n\n\n\nIt covers the export and import of services. These are categorized into twelve broad categories in the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition (BPM6) as follows; Manufacturing of Physical Inputs owned by Others; Maintenance and Repair Services; Transport; Travel; Construction; Insurance and Pension Services; Financial Services; Charges for the use of intellectual property n.i.e; Telecommunications, Computer and Information Services; Other Business Services (including Trade, Technical and related services,Research and development services, professional and management consulting services, waste treatment and depollution, agricultural and mining services, operating leasing, Trade related services ; Personal, cultural and recreation services; and Government goods and services n.i.e\n\n\n\nPrimary income captures returns for the provision of labor and financial assets; and renting of natural resources between resident and non-resident entities. This account records compensation of employees, income from investments such as dividends, interest, reinvested earnings; investment income attributable to policyholders in insurance, standardized guarantees, and pension funds; and rent.\n\n\n\nThis account records transfers of money or value between residents and non-residents, where no goods or services are exchanged. This includes:\n· Personal transfers: All current transfers in cash or in kind made or received by resident households to or from nonresident households. They include remittances sent by workers to their families in their home countries.\n· Other current transfers: These include Social contributions, social benefits,net premiums and claims on non-life insurance, Contributions from foreign governments, charitable donations, and other financial transfers, including aid and gifts.\n\n\n\nThe current account balance is the sum of the balances of the four sub-accounts:\nCurrent Account Balance (CAB) = Balance of the Goods Account + Services Account Balance + Balance in the Primary Income Account + Balance in the Secondary Income Account\n\n\n\nA current account surplus occurs when a country earns more income from abroad than it spends i.e. the CAB is a positive value. On the other hand, a current account deficit results from greater expenditure on goods produced or services rendered by non-residents as well as increased payments on factors of production, including interest and labour.\n\n\n\nThis account shows (a) capital transfers receivable and payable between residents and nonresidents and (b) the acquisition and disposal of non-produced, nonfinancial assets between residents and nonresidents.\nCapital transfers are transfers in which the ownership of an asset (other than cash or inventories) changes from one party to another; or which obliges one or both parties to acquire or dispose of an asset (other than cash or inventories); or where a liability is forgiven by the creditor. This include debt forgiveness, investment grants, one-off guarantees and debt assumption, large gifts and inheritances (legacies), including those to nonprofit institutions; cash grants from donor governments or multilateral financial institutions to the debtor economy to be used to repay debt\nNon-produced, non-financial assets consist of natural resources, contracts, leases and licenses; and marketing assets (including goodwill).\n\n\n\nThis account records transactions that involve financial assets and liabilities that take place between residents and nonresidents. It tracks cross-border investments and transactions that change the ownership of financial assets and liabilities. The financial account indicates the functional categories, sectors, instruments and maturities used for net international financing transactions. Entries in the financial account can be corresponding entries to goods, services, income, capital account, or other financial account entries. The financial account shows net acquisition of financial assets and net incurrence of liabilities. There are five functional categories in the Financial Account which include Direct Investment, Portfolio Investment, Other Investment, Financial Derivatives and Reserve Assets.\n\n\n\nThis arises when an entity, resident in one economy has equity shareholding or equivalent voting rights of 10% per cent or more in an entity resident in another economy that gives rise to a significant degree of influence or control in the management of this non-resident entity. A significant degree of influence exists when the non-resident Direct Investor has shareholding or equivalent voting rights of between 10 to 50 per cent of the value resident entity while control exists when the shareholding is more than 50 per cent.\nEnterprises in a direct investment relationship with each other are called affiliates or affiliated enterprises. In addition, all enterprises that are under the control or influence of the same direct investor are considered to be in a direct investment relationship with each other.\n\n\n\nThis is defined as cross border transactions and positions involving debt or equity securities, other than those included in direct investment or reserve assets. Investments by a non-resident in an economy in form of shares/voting rights of less than 10% (equity securities) and/or investment in financial instruments which are tradable (debt/non-equity securities). The negotiability of securities is a way of facilitating trading, allowing them to be held by different parties during their lives.\nPortfolio investment covers, but is not limited to, securities traded on organized or other financial markets and usually involves financial infrastructure, such as a suitable legal, regulatory, and settlement framework, along with market-making dealers, and a sufficient volume of buyers and sellers. Transactions in listed equity in the Securities markets or organized exchanges constitute Portfolio Investment.\n\n\n\nThis captures any other investment by a non-resident in an economy that cannot be classified either as Direct Investment, Portfolio Investment, financial derivatives and employee stock options; and reserve assets. This comprises other equity (less than 10% of voting rights and non-tradable); currency and deposits; loans (including the use of IMF credit and loans from the IMF); trade credits and advances; insurance, pension and standardized guarantee schemes; accounts payable and receivable; and SDR allocations.\nOther investments may be split by financial asset or liability class, original or remaining maturity, or institutional sector.\n\n\n\nReserve assets are those external assets that are readily available to and controlled by monetary authorities for meeting balance of payments financing needs, for intervention in exchange markets to affect the currency exchange rate, and for other related purposes (such as maintaining confidence in the currency and the economy; and serving as a basis for foreign borrowing). This includes central bank holdings of foreign exchange reserves, monetary gold, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) holdings, Reserve Position in the Fund and debt securities .\n\n\n\nInternational Investment Position (IIP) is a statistical statement that shows at a point in time the value and composition of financial assets of residents of an economy that are claims on nonresidents and gold bullion held as reserve assets; and liabilities of residents of an economy to non residents. The key components of IIP are similar to the components of the Financial Account of the Balance of Payments and include Direct Investment Assets/Liabilities, Portfolio Investment Assets/Liabilities, Other Investment Assets/Liabilities, Financial derivatives and Reserve Assets.\nThe difference between an economy’s external financial assets and liabilities is the economy’s net IIP, which may be positive or negative.\n\n\n\nThese are financial claims by residents of a country on non-residents/rest of the world. The existence of the counterpart liability distinguishes financial assets from other economic assets, such as land, dwellings, machinery, equipment, etc.\n\n\n\nFinancial liabilities are financial claims on residents by non-residents/rest of the world.\n\n\n\nConsists of all non-resident institutional units that enter into transactions with resident units, or have other economic links with resident units.\n\n\n\nA resident is an individual, entity or organization located in an economic territory, with which it has the centre of predominant economic interest. An enterprise incorporated in Kenya is considered a resident of Kenya irrespective of the location of the owners of the enterprise. A branch of a foreign enterprise operating (or intending to operate) in Kenya for more than a year is treated as a resident of Kenya. A household is resident in the economic territory in which household members maintain or intend to maintain a dwelling or succession of dwellings treated and used by members of the household as their principal dwelling. If an individual is present in a territory for one year or more or intending to do so is sufficient to qualify as having a principal dwelling there. If there is uncertainty about the principal dwelling, the length of time spent there should inform whether they are resident or not.\nA legal entity is resident in the economic territory under whose laws the entity is incorporated or registered. If there is no incorporation or registration, legal domicile is used to ascertain the residence of the entity.\nA Non Profit Institutions Serving Households (NPISH) has a center of economic interest in the economy in which the institution was legally created and is officially recognized and recorded as a legal or social entity. When an NPISH is engaged in charity or relief work on an international scale, it may maintain substantial operations for individual territories that may amount to branches.\nAn exception to this rule includes the following:\n\n  Diplomats of Foreign Governments, Embassies, Military bases of foreign governments, cross-border workers, Patients and Students who are residents of their economies.\nInternational/multilateral organizations who are not residents of any Government e.g. World Bank Group, International Monetary Fund. International organizations are resident in an economic territory of their own, and not of the economy in which they are physically located. Some international organizations cover a group of economies in a particular region, such as with economic or currency unions. If statistics are prepared for that region as a whole, these regional organizations are residents of the region as a whole, even though they are not residents of any member economy.\n\n\n\n\nA transaction is an interaction between two institutional units that occurs by mutual agreement or through the operation of the law and involves an exchange of value or a transfer. Transactions are classified according to the nature of the economic value provided—namely, goods or services, primary income, secondary income, capital transfers, nonproduced non-financial assets, financial assets, or liabilities. Transactions recorded in the BOP. are interactions between a resident and a nonresident institutional unit.\n\n\n\nStock of financial assets and liabilities at a specific point in time and are recorded in the IIP.\n\n\n\nThese are financial contracts made between institutional units and can be broadly divided into:\n· Equity and Investment Fund shares: These include shares and other forms of ownership in an enterprise.\n· Non-Equity/Debt Instruments: These include currency and deposits, debt securities, loans, trade credits and advances; other accounts receivables/payables, insurance, pension and standardized guarantee schemes, financial derivatives and employee stock options are also included in other financial instruments.\n\n\n\nIncome on equity not paid out to investors as dividends but retained in the enterprise (e.g., retained profits).\n\n\n\nChanges in the value of assets due to price changes and reflect nominal hold- ing gains and losses on environmental assets. The nominal holding gain for environmental assets is calculated in the same way as for non-financial assets, as the increase in value accruing to the owner of the asset as a result of a change in its price over a period of time. Holding gains and losses are realized when the asset is sold or liability extinguished. Holding gains and losses on unsold assets and unpaid liabilities are unrealized but are recorded as revaluations.\n\n\n\nSDRs are an international reserve asset created by the IMF, used to supplement its member countries’ official reserves. SDR holdings represent unconditional rights to obtain foreign exchange or other reserve assets from other IMF members. SDR holdings are classified as reserve assets in while SDR allocations are captured in Other Investments liabilities.\n\n\n\nValuation principles for measuring cross-border transactions and positions are market prices or book values for assets and liabilities.\n\n\n\nAccrual accounting records flows at the time economic value is created, transformed, exchanged, transferred, or extinguished. This means that flows that imply a change of economic ownership are recorded when ownership passes and services are recorded when provided, irrespective of whether cash was received or paid or was due to be received or paid.\n\n\n\nMarket prices for transactions are defined as amounts of money that willing buyers pay to acquire something from willing sellers; the exchanges are made between independent parties and on the basis of commercial considerations only—sometimes called “at arm’s length”. Transactions in loans, deposits, and other accounts receivable/ payable also should be valued at market prices. Transactions in financial assets and liabilities should be recorded exclusive of any commissions, fees, and taxes whether charged explicitly, included in the purchaser’s price, or deducted from the seller’s proceeds. When market prices for transactions are not observable, valuation according to market-equivalent prices provides approximation to market prices. In such cases, market prices of the same or similar items when such prices exist will provide a good basis for applying the principle of market prices.\n\n\n\nThe value recorded in the enterprises records.\n\n\n\nThe outstanding amount the debtor owes to the creditor, which is composed of the outstanding principal amount including any accrued interest. Therefore, the nominal value reflects the sum of funds originally advanced, plus any subsequent advances, plus any interest that has accrued, less any repayments (which includes any payments covering interest accrual). If a debt instrument is denominated in foreign currency, the corresponding nominal value of the instrument in domestic currency also includes holding gains or losses arising from exchange rate changes.\n\n\n\nThe amortized value of a loan reflects the process of gradual elimination of the liability by regular payments over a specified period of time. On the date of each scheduled payment, amortized value is the same as nominal value, but it may differ from the nominal value on other dates because nominal value includes interest that has accrued and not been paid.\n\n\n\nThe undiscounted amount to be paid to the holder at maturity. It is also known as “par value” or simply “par.” Before maturity, the market value of a bond may be greater or lesser than the face value, depending on the interest rate payable and the perceived risk of default. As bonds approach maturity, market value approaches face value. For example, if interest rates are higher than the bond’s coupon rate, then the bond is sold at a discount (below par). Conversely, if interest rates are lower than the bond’s coupon rate, then the bond is sold at a premium (above par).\n\n\n\nIn practice, data may not perfectly match due to various statistical discrepancies, either from source data or from compilation. This gives rise to net errors and omissions. While net errors and omissions is a residual item, the size and trends may help identify data problems, such as coverage or misreporting. Patterns in net errors and omissions may provide useful information on data problems. While it is not possible to have guidelines on an acceptable size for net errors and omissions, it can be assessed in relation to other items, such as GDP, current account balance, positions data, and gross flows.\n\n\n\nBPM6 provides guidance for compilation of BOP and IIP by attributing institutional units to the following sectors:\n● Central Bank\n○ Deposit taking Corporations except the Central Bank\n○ General government\n● Other Sectors\n■ Other financial corporations\n● Moneymarketfunds(MMFs)\n● Non-MMF Investment funds\n● Other financial intermediaries except insurance corporations and pension funds (ICPFs)\n● Financial auxiliaries\n● Captive financial institutions and money lenders\n● Insurance corporations\n● Pension funds\n■ Non-financial corporations, households, and NPISHs\n● Nonfinancial corporations\n● Households\n● NPISHs (non-profit institutions serving households; maybe combined with households)\nThe full institutional sector detail is required for international accounts to be fully integrated with monetary, flow of funds, and other financial data.\n\n\n\nBrings together financial arrangements made by the authorities (or by other sectors fostered by authorities) of an economy to meet Balance of Payments needs. Arrears related to exceptional financing are recorded below the line as transactions in the analytical presentation of the Balance of Payments with the corresponding entry in the relevant instrument.\n\n\n\nThis is a data collection system that obtains data from banks and companies at the level of individual transactions. An ideal ITRS measures: (1) cash transactions with nonresidents that pass through domestic banks; (2) cash transactions that pass-through enterprise accounts with banks abroad; (3) transactions on intercompany accounts with nonresident companies; (4) positions; and (5) noncash transactions.\nStatistics are compiled from forms submitted to/by domestic banks and from forms submitted by companies.\nHowever, the efficacy of the ITRS is based on the legal framework, accounting systems, and foreign exchange regulations of various economies. In Kenya, the ITRS is a major data source on cross border transactions. However, it is not sufficient to address all the BOP requirements hence the use of complimentary data sources, including surveys to enterprises.\n\n\n\nThe Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition (BPM6) is a comprehensive set of guidelines published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It provides standards for compiling and presenting Balance of Payments (BOP) and International Investment Positions (IIP).\n\n\n\n\nCovers statistical activities on the general government sector and the broader public sector. It covers the compilation of data on revenues, expenditures, transactions in financial assets and liabilities, and balance sheet data.\n\n\nClassification of the government outlays by functions, or socio-economic objectives, that general government units aim to achieve through the outlays.\n\n\n\nClassification of government outlays used to identify the types of expense incurred when a government supplies goods and services to the community or redistributes income and wealth.\n\n\n\nA transaction involving exchange and transfer that reduces the net worth of the government.\n\n\n\nA set of exchange and transfer transactions that increase the net worth of the government.\n\n\n\nThe expense involving total remuneration, in cash or in kind, payable to a government employee in return for work done during the accounting period, except for work connected to own-account capital formation\n\n\n\nAn expense that involves purchase of goods and services for production of market and nonmarket goods and services Plus goods purchased for resale Minus the change in inventories of materials, work-in- progress, finished goods, and goods held for resale. The value is recorded when goods or services are actually used rather than when they were acquired\n\n\n\nThe expense that a government unit (debtor) incurs for use of the principal outstanding, which is the economic value that has been provided by the creditor. Interest accrues continuously over period that the liability exists\n\n\n\nCurrent transfers that government units pay to enterprises either on the basis of the levels of their production activities or on the basis of the quantities or values of the goods or services that they produce, sell, or import.\n\n\n\nSocial benefits represent the government’s financial contributions to support its citizens’ welfare. They are typically non-market transfers (e.g., financial aid) aimed at improving economic security.\n\n\n\nCurrent transfers are voluntary transfers from the central government to other levels of government for the purpose their current expenditure\n\n\n\nCapital transfers are voluntary transfers from the central government to other levels of government for the purpose of their capital expenditure\n\n\n\nTransactions involving a monetary exchange for produced and non-produced fixed assets, inventories, valuables; most nonfinancial assets provide benefits either through their use in the production of goods and services or in the form of property income.\n\n\n\nThese are transactions that entail the government to a financial claim from a second unit; the financial assets include participation of equity, monetary gold, and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) allocated by the IMF.\n\n\n\nTotal outlays during an accounting period towards principal repayment thus reducing the liabilities for the government\n\n\n\nTaxes are compulsory unrequited transfers to the general government sector from resident households and enterprises.\n\n\n\nA consumption tax levied at each stage of production of goods and services based on the value added to the product at that stage.\n\n\n\nTax levied on specific goods and commodities produced or sold within the country.

It should be classified as a bank based on the types of activities undertaken and not based on the name alone. The most common services provided by commercial banks are accepting deposits and granting loans or other forms of finance to corporations and households.\n\n\n\nInstitutions providing financial services mainly credit, savings, insurance etc. to those sectors of the economy considered risky by commercial banks. Their target market is typically poor households and micro and small enterprises.\nThey can be classified into:\n\n    Microfinance banks\n    Non-deposit Microfinance\n    Digital Credit Providers\n\n\n\n\nThe ability to sell assets quickly and in large volume without substantially affecting their price. A financial asset is liquid if, at short notice and minimum cost, it can be bought, sold, redeemed at, or close to, full value. This means that to be liquid, a financial asset must be exchangeable against a medium of exchange with minimum cost and time, and without unduly affecting the value of the asset.\n\n\n\nAll funds received or held by the reporting institution on behalf of third parties that are represented by evidence of deposit. This item covers the reporting institution’s deposit liabilities of all maturities with credit balances\n\n\n\nFunds borrowed by the institutions and individuals from institutional units/sectors which are evidenced by on-negotiable documents, including credit cards.\n\n\n\nA loan is non-performing when payments of interest or principal are past due by 90 days or more.

Repurchase Agreements (Repo) are conducted whenever the Central Bank is mopping up excess liquidity from the domestic market. A Repo is a collateralized loan involving a contractual arrangement between two parties, whereby one party sells a security at a specified price with a commitment to buy back the same at a later date.\n\n\n\nThe rate of interest charged on short-term loans between banks. Banks borrow and lend money in the interbank lending market in order to manage liquidity and satisfy regulations such as reserve requirements.\n\n\n\nOverdraft is a financial instrument to provide an extension of credit when the current account balance reaches zero.\n\n\n\nThis is the difference between the Loans and Advances interest rate and the Average Deposits rate.\n\n\n\nLending interest rate adjusted for inflation\n\n\n\nThis is a financial market for companies seeking to raise equity capital. It offers a liquid market for issuers enabling them to access a wide range of domestic and international retail and institutional investors.\n\n\n\nLong term insurance business comprises life assurance, annuities, deposit administration, group life, group credit, investments, personal pensions and permanent health.\n\n\n\nThis is a short term or annual insurance arrangement and can be broadly categorized into two; Personal (for individuals) and commercial (for commercial entities).

Electricity can be generated through different processes such as the conversion of energy contained in falling or streaming water, wind or waves; the direct conversion of solar radiation through photovoltaic processes in semiconductor devices (solar cells); or by the combustion of fuels.\nIn Kenya, electric power is mainly generated from renewable sources like Geothermal, solar and wind and/or non-renewable sources including thermal sources.\n\n\n\nThese are units that produce electricity or heat as their principal activity. Formerly known as public utilities, these enterprises may be privately or publicly owned companies.\n\n\n\nThese are units that produce electricity, but for which the production is not their principal activity.\n\n\n\nThese are units that produce heat for sale, but for which the production is not their principal activity. Deliveries of fuels for heat generated by a unit for its own purposes are classified as final consumption, and not as transformation inputs.\n\n\n\nPlants producing only electricity. The electricity may be obtained directly from natural sources such as hydro, geothermal, wind, tidal, marine, solar energy or from fuel cells, or from the heat obtained from the combustion of fuels or nuclear reactions.\n\n\n\nPlants that produce both heat and electricity from at least one generating unit in the plant. They are sometimes referred to as “co-generation” plants.\n\n\n\nPlants (including heat pumps and electric boilers) designed to produce heat only for deliveries to third parties. Deliveries of fuels for heat generated by an autoproducer for its own purposes are classified as final consumption.\n\n\n\nElectricity produced from solar photovoltaics,i.e. by the direct conversion of solar radiation through photovoltaic processes in semiconductor devices (solar cells), including concentrating photovoltaic systems.\n\n\n\nElectricity produced from solar heat (both concentrating and non-concentrating).\n\n\n\nElectricity produced from devices driven by wind.\n\n\n\nElectricity produced from devices driven by fresh, flowing or falling water.\n\n\n\nElectricity produced from devices driven by the motion of waves.\n\n\n\nElectricity generated from devices driven by tidal currents or the differences of water level caused by tides.\n\n\n\nElectricity generated from devices that exploit sources of marine energy not elsewhere specified. Examples of such sources are non-tidal currents, temperature differences and salinity gradients in seas or salinity differences between sea and fresh water.\n\n\n\nElectricity generated from the heat from geothermal sources.\n\n\n\nElectricity generated by nuclear heat.\n\n\n\nElectricity generated from heat recovered from a non-combusting chemical reaction.\n\n\n\nElectricity produced from sources not elsewhere specified (including fuel cells).\n\n\n\nThe generation of heat from solar thermal (concentrating and non-concentrating). Heat from concentrating solar thermal refers to high temperature heat produced from solar radiation captured by concentrating solar thermal systems.\nThe high temperature heat can be transformed to generate electricity, drive chemical reactions, or be used directly in industrial processes. Heat from non-concentrating solar thermal refers to low temperature heat produced from solar radiation captured by non-concentrating solar thermal systems. The heat can be used for applications, such as space heating, cooling, water heating, district heating and industrial processes.\n\n\n\nIn energy statistics, energy consumers consist of economic units (enterprises and households) that act as final users of energy; they use energy products for energy purposes (heat raising, transportation and electrical services) and/or for non-energy purposes. It should be noted that the economic units belonging to the energy industries that use energy to produce other energy products are excluded from this group. Their energy use, by convention, is not part of the final consumption of energy and is considered separately as energy industries own use\n\n\n\nEnergy transmission refers to the process of transporting electrical energy, typically at high voltages, from power generation sources to substations, and then onward to distribution networks. It’s a crucial part of the electrical power grid, ensuring that electricity generated at power plants can be delivered to where it is needed.\n\n\n\nThe process of delivering energy, primarily electricity, from generation sources to end-users\n[Note: The energy section continues with many more detailed definitions about energy production, transformation, trade, and consumption that would be included in the full chapter]\n\n\n\n\n[Definitions for mining, manufacturing and construction sectors would be included here]\n\n\n\n\n\nMovement of people, animals, and goods from one location to the other using modes of transport such as air, rail, road, water and pipeline.\n\n\n\nMovement of people from one location to the other using modes of transport such as air, rail, road, water and pipeline.\n\n\n\nAny person who makes a journey including infants in arms but excluding on-duty crew.\n\n\n\nAny property carried in a transport mode other than passenger baggage.\n\n\n\nPersonal property of passengers and crew loaded or carried on board an aircraft by agreement with the operator.\n\n\n\nMeans travelling to and from one’s daily work.\n\n\n\nThe conveyance of people for reward (fare) by any travel mode e.g. by car, metered taxi, matatu, bus, rail, etc.\n\n\n\nAn area of land (including any buildings, installations and equipment) for use either wholly or in part for the arrival and departure of vehicles, or trains.\n\n\n\nMovements by vehicles, aircraft, ships, passengers, freight or mail, departing or arriving at airports, stations, ports, and parks.\n\n\n\nThe application of engineering measures such as traffic calming and/or road marking, road signs and traffic signals to regulate the use of road space and the speed and flow of traffic.\n[Note: The transport section continues with many more detailed definitions for air transport, railway transport, road transport, pipeline transport, sea transport, and inland waterway transport]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe activities of persons travelling to and staying in places outside their usual environment, for less than a year, for any main purpose, including business, leisure or other personal purpose, whose main purpose of trip is not the exercise of an activity remunerated from within the place visited.\n[Note: The tourism section continues with detailed definitions about visitors, tourists, accommodation, and tourism expenditure]",

It assumes the conservation of natural assets for future growth and development.\n\n\nAlso known as the Global Goals, they are an intergovernmental set of development goals which were adopted by the United Nations member states in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity.\n\n\n\nThe SDG includes 17 goals, 169 targets and 248 indicators. The goals set the aspiration of what the SDGs are trying to achieve. The 169 targets are the areas of change that need to be reached in order to achieve the 17 goals. Indicators are used to measure the progress on the target and goal.\n\n\n\nA standardized set of 231 indicators adopted by the UN to monitor SDGs progress.\n\n\n\nCountry-led assessments presented at the UN to report on SDGs implementation.\n\n\n\nA global movement to improve data quality, timeliness, and inclusivity for better decisions.\n\n\n\nA visual, interactive tool for tracking progress across the SDGs and indicators.\n\n\n\n\nThe inalienable rights to which a person is entitled merely for being human. Human rights are built on underlying principles of universality, indivisibility, equality, participation, accountability and non-discrimination, and are enshrined in international human rights law, rules of customary international law, national laws and other standards that define them and help to guarantee their full enjoyment.\nInherent claims to social arrangements that protect each and every person from abuses and deprivation that would prevent them from attaining their full potential.\n\n\nThe various human rights monitoring mechanisms of the United Nations system. These include UN Charter-based bodies (including the Human Rights Council, Universal Periodic Review and special procedures) and treaty-based bodies created under the international human rights treaties (known as treaty bodies).\n\n\n\nA conceptual framework underpinning human development and humanitarian action that is normatively based on international human rights standards and operationally directed to promoting and protecting human rights. A human rights-based approach identifies rights-holders and their entitlements and corresponding duty-bearers and their obligations, and works towards strengthening the capacities of rights-holders to make their claims and of duty-bearers to meet their obligations. It is not only about achieving human rights goals and outcomes, but also about achieving them through a participatory, inclusive, nondiscriminatory, transparent and responsive process.\n\n\n\nDocuments that form the primary legal basis of United Nations activities to promote, protect and monitor human rights and fundamental freedoms. These include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(ICCPR).\n\n\n\nLimitations placed by States on the exercise of certain human rights where they have valid reasons to do so, such as to protect the rights and freedoms of others, for national security, or to protect public health or morals. The burden falls upon States to prove that a limitation imposed upon the enjoyment of the right is legitimate.\n\n\n\nThose human rights which cannot be subjected to limitations or suspensions under any conditions, including in times of public emergency. They include the right to life; the right not to be subjected to torture, or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; freedom from slavery and servitude; freedom of thought, conscience and religion. These rights are also known as peremptory norms of international law or jus cogens norms.\n\n\n\nA core principle of international human rights and refugee law that prohibits States from returning individuals in any manner whatsoever (whether directly or indirectly) to territories where they may be at risk of persecution, torture, or other forms of serious or irreparable harm.\n\n\n\nA State institution established by Law or Constitution with a broad mandate to promote and protect human rights.

This category may include certain journalists and trade unionists. While the term “human rights advocate” is often used synonymously, “human rights defender” is preferred as it aligns more closely with internationally agreed human rights standards and established practice.\n\n\n\nAny extrajudicial or unlawful execution carried out by State actors or by other actors with the State’s permission, support, or acquiescence, motivated by the victim or someone associated with the victim engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender; or committed while the victim was undertaking such activities. This also includes killings by individuals or groups not supported by the State when the act was motivated by the victim’s engagement in such activities and/or was met with a lack of due diligence by the State in responding to the harm, with such inaction motivated by the victim’s or associate’s role. It also includes unlawful attacks and destruction in violation of international humanitarian law that result in or are intended to cause the victim’s death.\n\n\n\nThe arrest, detention, abduction, or any other form of deprivation of liberty of a person by State agents or by persons acting with the authorization, support, or acquiescence of the State, where such acts are motivated by the victim’s or an associate’s engagement in activities as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender.

In some countries, it has a legal meaning, referring to an individual who has applied for refugee or complementary protection status and is awaiting a final decision. It may also refer to individuals who intend to apply or who may be in need of such protection.\n\n\n\nThe forced or compelled movement of individuals from their homes or habitual places of residence either within their country or across borders due to armed conflict, generalized violence, human rights violations, or natural or human-made disasters.\n\n\n\nA marriage in which one or both parties have not given their full and free consent. Child marriage is considered a form of forced marriage and constitutes a violation of human rights.\n\n\n\nA fundamental human right comprising the freedom to move within a country, the right to leave any country, and the right to return to one’s own country.\n\n\n\nAll activities aimed at ensuring full respect for the rights of individuals in line with the principles and provisions of international human rights, refugee, and humanitarian law.\n\n\n\nThe ability of an individual, household or community to meet essential needs and to enjoy social and economic rights in a sustainable manner and with dignity.\n\n\n\n\nGender statistics refer to statistics that adequately reflect differences and inequalities between women and men in all areas of life. Gender statistics are more than just statistics about women or sex-disaggregated data. They include:\n· Sex-disaggregated data;\n· Data pertaining specifically to women or men;\n· Data capturing gender issues, even if they do not explicitly mention gender, sex, or women and men.\n\n\nGender is a socio-cultural construct that defines and determines the roles, responsibilities, entitlements, and limitations of women, men, girls, and boys in society. It influences their societal position and varies across time, space, and context. Gender refers to the roles and expectations assigned by society, not biology.\n\n\n\nSex refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that distinguish females and males. These characteristics are natural, unlike gender, which is socially constructed and shaped by historical, cultural, and relational contexts.\n\n\n\nGender analysis examines how differences in roles, responsibilities, needs, opportunities, and rights affect women, men, girls, and boys. It analyzes their constraints and the impacts of these differences to inform policies and programs. This analysis highlights gender gaps and supports equitable development planning.\n\n\n\nThese are socially constructed relationships between women and men in a given cultural context. They differ from biological distinctions and influence power dynamics, access to resources, and social positioning.\n\n\n\nGender issues refer to challenges, opportunities, and barriers affecting both women and men, girls and boys. They are not synonymous with women’s issues.\n\n\n\nThis is the process of incorporating gender considerations into planning and development initiatives. It acknowledges that programs affect women/girls and men/boys differently. The use of sex-disaggregated data is essential in policymaking, planning, budgeting, and decision-making.\n\n\n\nGender inequality refers to unequal access to resources, opportunities, and benefits for women and men. It hinders individual development, national growth, and societal progress.\n\n\n\nGender statistics reflect the socio-cultural realities of women, men, girls, and boys. They include sex-disaggregated data and other statistics relevant to gender-related issues.\n\n\n\nData categorized separately for males and females. This disaggregation is essential for identifying inequalities and conducting effective gender analysis.\n\n\n\nData that are broken down by sex and other variables such as age, location, ethnicity, disability, socio-economic status, and education. These distinctions help reveal hidden inequalities.\n\n\n\nData focused exclusively on women, often used to highlight their situation. However, they do not allow for comparisons with men and cannot fully reveal gender gaps.\n\n\n\nBias arising from decisions or assumptions based on gender, often favoring men or boys over women or girls.\n\n\n\nAssigning specific attributes, characteristics, or roles to individuals solely based on their gender. Stereotyping becomes harmful when it limits opportunities or choices, particularly in education, careers, or personal development.\n\n\n\nThe condition in which women and men, girls and boys have equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities. Gender equality ensures that individuals can realize their full potential without discrimination based on gender.\n\n\n\nMeasures used to assess progress toward gender equality. These may be quantitative (e.g., statistics, figures) or qualitative (e.g., perceptions, experiences).\n\n\n\nThe principle of fairness in treatment for women and men, accounting for different needs, interests, and experiences. It may require special measures to address historic or systemic disadvantages.\n\n\n\nThe measurable difference between women and men in terms of access to opportunities, resources, and participation in various sectors.\n\n\n\nStatistical differences, often called gaps, between men and women that reflect unequal conditions or outcomes.\n\n\n\nGender parity is a numerical measure that reflects relative equality in terms of the number and proportion of women and men, or girls and boys. It is commonly calculated as the ratio of female to male values for a given indicator. When the ratio is calculated as male to female instead, the term “sex ratio” is used rather than “gender parity.”\n\n\n\nThe Gender Parity Index (GPI) measures the relative access to education of female and male students. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of females to the number of males enrolled at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of education.\n\n\n\nThe GDI is a tool used to measure gender inequalities in the social, cultural, economic, and political spheres. It assesses gender gaps in human development across three key dimensions:\n\n  Health – measured by female and male life expectancy at birth;\nEducation – measured by female and male expected years of schooling for children and mean years of schooling for adults aged 25 and above;\n Economic resources – measured by estimated earned income for females and males.\n\n\n\n\nGender blindness refers to the failure to recognize that the roles and responsibilities of women/girls and men/boys are socially and culturally constructed. Gender-blind studies, programs, projects, policies, and attitudes maintain the status quo, overlooking diverse needs and roles, and therefore fail to transform unequal gender relations.\n\n\n\nGender roles are social and behavioral norms that a given culture considers appropriate for individuals of a specific sex. These roles often determine traditional tasks and responsibilities assigned to women, men, boys, and girls, and are shaped by factors such as household structure, access to resources, the global economy, conflict, disasters, and local ecological conditions.\n\n\n\nGender norms are the accepted attributes and behaviors associated with male and female identities in a specific society or community at a particular point in time. They establish standards and expectations of how men and women should act. Internalized early in life, gender norms influence lifelong gender socialization and stereotypes.\n\n\n\nGender planning is an approach that acknowledges the different roles of women and men in society and recognizes that their needs often differ.\n\n\n\nThese are the requirements necessary for women and men to improve their status or position in society. Addressing strategic gender needs enables individuals to move beyond restrictive social roles. For women, these needs may include land rights, decision-making power, equal pay, and access to credit.\n\n\n\nGender relations are a specific subset of social relations that define interactions between men and women as social groups. These relations intersect with other social influences—such as age, ethnicity, race, and religion—to shape individuals’ status and identity. As social constructs, gender relations can be changed.\n\n\n\nGender balance refers to equal participation of women and men in all areas of work and within programs initiated or supported by institutions. Achieving gender balance creates a more inclusive environment, enhances policy and program effectiveness, and strengthens institutional capacity to serve the entire population.\n\n\n\nIt’s the awareness of gender differences and the willingness to adjust and adapt policies, programs, or actions accordingly. It is closely related to gender sensitivity.\n\n\n\nTaking a gender perspective involves considering gender-based differences in any social phenomenon, policy, or process. It emphasizes differences in status and power and examines how gender-based discrimination shapes both immediate needs and long-term interests. In policymaking, a gender perspective ensures that women’s and men’s experiences are equally considered in the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of programs and policies.\n\n\n\nGender mainstreaming is the systematic integration of a gender perspective into the preparation, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of policies, regulations, and spending programs, with the aim of promoting gender equality and eliminating discrimination.\n\n\n\nThis involves the systematic consideration of gender issues and the elimination of gender-based bias throughout all stages of statistical production.\n\n\n\nAll procedures involving the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.\n\n\n\nAll acts of physical, sexual, psychological, or economic violence occurring within the family or domestic setting. This applies regardless of biological or legal ties and includes violence between current or former spouses or partners, whether or not they share a residence.\n\n\n\nAn umbrella term for any harmful act perpetrated against a person based on socially ascribed gender differences. GBV varies across cultures and regions and includes sexual violence, domestic violence, trafficking, forced or early marriage, harmful traditional practices (e.g., FGM, honor killings, widow inheritance), and more. These acts may occur in both public and private settings.\n\n\n\nThese refer to the unique opportunities, challenges, and constraints that affect women and girls. Due to inadequate representation at decision-making levels, their needs are often overlooked or inadequately addressed.\n\n\n\nThe WID approach highlights the marginalization of women in development processes. It advocates for the inclusion of women in development initiatives to ensure that they benefit equally from resources and interventions.\n\n\n\nRefers to enhancing the personal, political, social, or economic strength of individuals and communities. Women’s empowerment enables them to gain control over their lives through increased awareness, confidence, choice, access to resources, and transformation of discriminatory structures and institutions.\n\n\n\nRefers to enabling women to participate equally in and benefit from decent work, social protection, market access, and control over resources, time, and decision-making. It also involves increasing women’s voice, agency, and participation in economic decisions at all levels, from the household to international institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA person with a disability is someone who has a long-term physical, psychological, intellectual, or sensory impairment which, in interaction with various barriers, may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.\n\n\n\nDisability cash benefits refer to financial payments made to individuals who are fully or partially unable to engage in gainful employment due to a disability. The disability may be congenital or acquired as a result of an accident or illness during the individual’s lifetime. These benefits do not include those resulting from prescribed industrial accidents or occupational diseases, which are classified under occupational injury and disease. The provision of goods and services in kind is categorized under services for the elderly and persons with disabilities.\n\n\n\nStateless persons are individuals who are not recognized as nationals by any state under the operation of its laws; either because they never acquired a nationality or because they lost it without obtaining a new one.\n\n\n\nThis refers to stateless individuals who have never crossed an international border but remain in their “own country”- a place where they have long-standing and significant ties, usually through birth or long-term residence. Their statelessness is often the result of shortcomings in the design or implementation of nationality laws.\n\n\n\nIndigenous peoples are communities, groups, or individuals who are descended from the original inhabitants of a country or region, and who retain distinct social, cultural, economic, and political characteristics. They often maintain their own languages, traditions, customs, and institutions and have a strong connection to ancestral lands and natural resources. Indigenous peoples typically identify themselves as such and are recognized by others as belonging to distinct cultural groups. Despite their diversity, they frequently face challenges related to marginalization, land rights, and preservation of cultural heritage.\n\n\n\nA guardian is an independent adult who safeguards a child’s best interests and general well-being and complements the child’s limited legal capacity.\n\n\n\nAn unaccompanied child is one who has been separated from both parents and other relatives and is not being cared for by an adult who, by law or custom, is responsible for doing so.\n\n\n\nAlternative care refers to arrangements made for children who are temporarily or permanently deprived of their family environment or whose best interests require placement outside their family.\n\n\n\nAs stated in Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC): “In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.”\n\n\n\nJustice for children refers to a United Nations framework and set of guiding principles aimed at ensuring that justice systems better serve and protect children. It promotes full adherence to international norms and standards for all children who come into contact with justice or related systems, whether as victims, witnesses, alleged offenders, or for matters involving care, custody, or protection.\n\n\n\nJuvenile justice is a justice system designed specifically for children or young persons who are considered juveniles under the respective legal system. It ensures that offenses committed by juveniles are addressed in a manner distinct from how adult offenses are treated. Age limits defining juveniles vary by country.\n\n\n\nAccording to the United Nations, an older person is someone aged 60 years or older. However, in many communities, age is also determined by socio-cultural markers such as family status (e.g., being a grandparent), physical appearance (e.g., grey hair, wrinkles), or age-related health conditions.\n\n\n\nThere is no universally agreed international definition of “youth.” For statistical purposes, however, the United Nations defines youth as individuals between the ages of 15 and 24 years, without prejudice to definitions adopted by individual Member States.\n\n\n\nThis term traditionally refers to all individuals for whom the UNHCR is mandated to provide protection, assistance, and durable solutions. It includes refugees, asylum-seekers, refugee returnees, stateless persons, and—in many situations—internally displaced persons (IDPs), including those supported by State and non-State partners.\n\n\n\n\nLiving conditions are the circumstances or factors affecting the way in which people live, particularly with regard to their well-being. The term ‘living conditions’ is closely related to that of ’quality of life.\nPoverty is a state or condition in which an individual lacks the financial resources and essentials for a basic standard of living.\n\n\nWelfare analysis, in economics, is the study of how policies or market changes affect the well-being of individuals and society, primarily by measuring the net benefits to consumers and producers.\n\n\n\nPoverty is a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, such as food, clean water, shelter, education, and healthcare (monetary and non-monetary). It typically results from a lack of access to resources or opportunities to improve one’s economic situation. Poverty is often measured by income levels, with individuals or households falling below a certain income threshold considered to be in poverty. However, poverty also encompasses other dimensions, including social exclusion, lack of access to essential services, and limited opportunities for economic and social advancement.\n\n\n\nHousehold expenditure refers to the total spending by a person living alone or a group of people living together on goods and services within a specific time period.\n\n\n\nHousehold consumption is the quantity of goods and services that the household enjoys in a given period.\n\n\n\nHousehold consumption expenditure includes those money outlays directed toward consumption (e.g., it excludes outlays for investment purposes).\n\n\n\nData used in analysis refers to the specific information, collected and prepared, that is subjected to various techniques and methods to extract meaningful insights, support decision-making, and draw conclusions. It encompasses raw data that has been organized, cleaned, and potentially transformed to make it suitable for analysis.\n\n\n\nThe recall period in an interview refers to the specific timeframe that respondents are asked to remember or reflect upon when providing information. It is a key aspect in survey design, especially in interviews related to data collection on behaviors, expenditures, or experiences.\nIn an interview about household income, the recall period might be “the last month” or “the past year,” and respondents would be asked to report their income or expenditures during that specific period. The choice of recall period is important because it affects the accuracy and reliability of the responses. If the recall period is too long, respondents may forget details or provide inaccurate information. If it is too short, the information might not capture enough relevant data to make meaningful conclusions.\n\n\n\nRecall interviews with a 7-day recall period are used for the collection of food consumption data, as this method provides a good balance between accuracy and cost-effectiveness.\n\n\n\nRecall interviews with a 1-month recall period are used for the collection of frequent non-food consumption data.\n\n\n\nRecall interviews with a 6-month recall period are used for the collection of less frequent non-food consumption data.\n\n\n\nRecall interviews with a 1-year recall period are used for the collection of durable goods consumption data.\n\n\n\nThe computation of a consumption-based welfare measure consists of assembling the so-called nominal consumption aggregate (NCA) from survey data. NCA is defined as the value of all goods and services consumed by members of the household during the reference period (see Household Consumption Expenditure).\n\n\n\nAll surveys should collect data on all main modes of food acquisition, namely:\na) Purchases;\nb) Household’s own production; and\nc) Received in kind/gifts, etc.\n\n\n\nFood from own production includes products usually sold as part of a household’s main commercial enterprise that are instead reserved for consumption (farm households are a typical example), as well as non-commercial and subsistence food production, and food acquired from hunting, fishing, and gathering.\n\n\n\nFood received in kind in the form of transfers from other households, the private sector, or the government.\n\n\n\n“Food away from home” generally refers to food prepared away from home, regardless of whether the food is consumed outside or inside the home. This includes meals and snacks purchased from restaurants and other commercial establishments (including takeout meals), received in-kind at school, at work, from other households, etc.\n\n\n\nThe non-food non-durable items of the non-food component of the NCA will include all the items in Division 03 “Clothing and Footwear” through to Category 13 “Personal Care, Social Protection, and Miscellaneous Goods,” referencing the Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP), the international reference classification of household expenditures (United Nations, 2018).\n\n\n\nThe durable goods/items of the non-food component of the NCA include those defined by their durability—meaning their ability to deliver useful services through repeated use over an extended period. Examples include automobiles, household appliances, and electronic devices.\n\n\n\nHedonic rent imputation is a method used in economic analysis to estimate the value of housing or real estate, accounting for attributes that influence price, such as location, size, amenities, and condition. The “hedonic pricing model” assumes the price of a good (in this case, housing) is determined by the sum of the values of its individual characteristics.\n\n\n\nAdjusting for price variation refers to accounting for differences in prices over time or across locations when comparing economic data, such as income, expenditure, or living standards. This adjustment—using either Paasche or Laspeyres price deflators—eliminates the influence of price changes or regional disparities to enable like-for-like comparisons.\n\n\n\nThis refers to modifying economic indicators (such as income or expenditure) to account for differences in the number and characteristics of household members (e.g., age, gender) using equivalence scales or consumption needs.\n\n\n\nA description of how the extent of poverty varies across sub-groups of a given population, characterized by gender, geographical location, type of economic activity, income source, etc.\n\n\n\nThe poverty line is a monetary threshold determined at a specific time and location, representing the minimum level of income or consumption expenditure required to meet basic needs, including food, housing, clothing, and healthcare.\n\n\n\nThe food poverty line represents the minimum monetary threshold in Kenyan Shillings required to meet nutritional needs based on consumption patterns. It is calculated based on food that provides 2,250 Kcal per adult equivalent per day, over a 30-day period.\n\n\n\nThe monetary threshold in Kenyan Shillings required to purchase a combination of food and non-food items per adult equivalent per month.\n\n\n\nIndividuals (or households, if estimated at the household level) whose food consumption per adult equivalent falls below the food poverty line in rural or urban areas are considered food poor or in “food poverty.”\n\n\n\nIndividuals (or households) whose total (food and non-food) consumption per adult equivalent falls below the overall poverty line are considered in “overall poverty.”\n\n\n\nIndividuals (or households) whose total consumption per adult equivalent is below the food poverty line are considered in “hardcore poverty.”\n\n\n\nThe proportion of individuals (or households) whose total consumption falls below the poverty line. It is the most commonly used measure of poverty due to its simplicity and ease of interpretation.\n\n\n\nThe poverty gap index measures the average shortfall from the poverty line as a percentage. It reflects the mean distance of the poor from the poverty line, with those above the line considered to have zero shortfall. It also indicates the minimum cost to eliminate poverty under perfect targeting.\n\n\n\nThis index squares each poverty gap before averaging, placing greater weight on the poorest. It accounts for inequality among the poor. Proposed by Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (1984), it is part of a class of poverty measures varying the weight of deprivation severity.\n\n\n\nThe Gini coefficient measures inequality in consumption expenditure. A value of 0 indicates perfect equality, while a value of 100 indicates maximum inequality (i.e., one individual has all the expenditure).\n\n\n\nA measure of poverty that considers factors beyond income, such as education, health, and living standards.\n\n\n\n\nClimate change refers to any significant change in the measures of climate lasting for an extended period of time. In other words, climate change includes major changes in temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns, among others, that occur over several decades or longer. It is attributed directly or indirectly to human (anthropogenic) activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere. The term is frequently used in reference to global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activities.\n\n\nRefers to the condition of the atmosphere at a particular location (microclimate) or region over a long period of time. It is the long-term summation of atmospheric elements – such as solar radiation, temperature, humidity, precipitation type (frequency and amount), atmospheric pressure, and wind (speed and direction) – and their variations.\n\n\n\nWeather is the state of the atmosphere of a given place at a given time. The elements of weather include, but are not limited to, rainfall, temperature, pressure, wind, cloud cover, and humidity.\n\n\n\nThe totality of all the external conditions (physical, biological, and socio-economic) affecting the life, development, and survival of an organism.\n\n\n\nA numerical representation of the climate system based on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of its components, their interactions, and feedback processes, and accounting for some of its known properties. The climate system can be represented by models of varying complexity; that is, for any one component or combination of components, a spectrum or hierarchy of models can be identified, differing in such aspects as the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to which physical, chemical, or biological processes are explicitly represented, or the level at which empirical parametrizations are involved.\n\n\n\nA probabilistic statement about future climate conditions on timescales ranging from seasons to decades. It is based on conditions known at present and assumptions about the physical processes that will determine future changes. When a projection is branded “most likely,” it becomes a prediction, and outputs of which can enable some level of confidence to be attached to projections.\n\n\n\nThe simulated response of the climate system to a scenario of future emissions or concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols, generally derived using climate models. Projections provide a potential future evolution of a quantity or set of quantities, often computed with the aid of a model. Climate projections are distinguished from climate predictions by their dependence on the emission/concentration/radiative forcing scenario used, which is, in turn, based on assumptions concerning, for example, future socio-economic and technological developments that may or may not be realized. Unlike predictions, projections are conditional on assumptions concerning such future developments.\n\n\n\nThe iterative processes for managing change within complex systems in order to reduce disruptions and enhance opportunities associated with climate change.\n\n\n\nThe potential for consequences from climate variability and change where something of value is at stake and the outcome is uncertain. Often represented as the probability that a hazardous event or trend occurs multiplied by the expected impact. Risk results from the interaction of vulnerability, exposure, and hazard.\n\n\n\nVariations in the mean state and other statistics (e.g., standard deviations, occurrence of extremes) of the climate across all spatial and temporal scales beyond that of individual weather events. Variability may be due to natural internal processes within the climate system (internal variability), or to variations in natural or anthropogenic external forcing (external variability).\n\n\n\nAir pollutants are substances in air that could, at high enough concentrations, harm human beings, animals, vegetation, or material. Air pollutants may consist of solid particles, liquid droplets, gases, or combinations of these forms.\n\n\n\nAir pollution is the presence of contaminant or pollutant substances in the air that do not disperse properly and interfere with human health or welfare, or produce other harmful environmental effects.\n\n\n\nAir pollution control refers to steps taken to maintain a standard of air purity for good public health, protection of plant and animal life and property, visibility, and safe ground and air transportation.\n\n\n\nAn air pollution index (API) is a quantitative measure that describes ambient air quality. The index is obtained by combining figures for various air pollutants into a single measurement.\n\n\n\nAir pollution sources are activities that result in air pollution, including agricultural activities, combustion processes, dust-producing processes, manufacturing activities, nuclear energy-related activities, spray painting, printing, dry cleaning, and so on.\n\n\n\nIndoor air pollution refers to chemical, biological, and physical contamination of indoor air which may result in adverse health effects. In developing countries, the main source is biomass smoke, which contains suspended particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).\n\n\n\nAir quality criteria are guidelines or standards established to protect human health and the environment from the harmful effects of air pollution. These criteria typically define acceptable concentrations of specific pollutants in the ambient (outdoor) air. They are used for various purposes, including public health protection, environmental protection, and urban planning.\n\n\n\nAir quality standards refer to levels of air pollutants prescribed by regulations that may not be exceeded during a specified time in a defined area.\n\n\n\nAn analytical method, using input-output techniques, to describe emissions according to their origin (production, consumption, and imports) and final demand categories (final consumption, capital formation, and exports).\n\n\n\nEmission is the release of pollutants into the atmosphere (usually a gas when referring to climate change) from stationary sources such as smokestacks, other vents, surface areas of commercial or industrial facilities, and mobile sources, such as motor vehicles, locomotives, and aircraft.\n\n\n\nEmission damage refers to the effects of (air) pollution on buildings, monuments, organisms, and ecosystems.\n\n\n\nThe emission factor is the ratio between the amount of pollution generated and the amount of a given raw material processed. It may also refer to the ratio between emissions generated and the outputs of production processes.\n\n\n\nAn emission inventory is a listing, by source, of the amounts of pollutants actually or potentially discharged. Such an inventory is used to establish and put forth emission standards.\n\n\n\nAn emission standard is the maximum amount of polluting discharge legally allowed from a single source, mobile or stationary.\n\n\n\nHybrid flow accounts limited to the description of the uses of fossil fuels and corresponding air emissions.\n\n\n\nThe right to generate, in the course of production activity, a certain amount of specific emissions, for example, greenhouse gases. Emissions permits are a form of intangible non-produced assets.\n\n\n\nOzone (O₃) is a pungent, colourless, toxic gas that contains three atoms of oxygen in each molecule. It occurs naturally at a concentration of about 0.01 parts per million (ppm) of air. Levels of 0.1 ppm are considered toxic. In the stratosphere, ozone provides a protective layer shielding the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. In the troposphere, it is a major component of photochemical smog, which seriously affects the human respiratory system.\n\n\n\nOzone depletion is the destruction of ozone in the stratosphere, where it shields the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Its destruction is caused by chemical reactions in which oxides of hydrogen, nitrogen, chlorine, and bromine act as catalysts.\n\n\n\nThe ozonosphere is the lower region of the stratosphere, 15–25 kilometres above the Earth’s surface, in which there is an appreciable ozone concentration. It is also termed the ozone layer.\n\n\n\nThe aggregate measure of the ozone layer-depleting potential of substances, calculated through the conversion factor of halogenated hydrocarbons that contribute to ozone depletion into CFC-11 equivalents.\n\n\n\nMeasures to control the emissions of greenhouse gases and gases that adversely affect the stratospheric ozone layer (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and halons).\n\n\n\nGlobal warming is a phenomenon believed to occur as a result of the build-up of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. It has been identified by many scientists as a major global environmental threat.\n\n\n\nAn aggregate measure of the contribution to the greenhouse effect of some gases, expressed by converting them into carbon dioxide equivalents.\n\n\n\nGreenhouse gases refer to carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, ozone, and chlorofluorocarbons, occurring both naturally and from human (production and consumption) activities, contributing to the greenhouse effect.\n\n\n\nThe greenhouse effect is the warming of the Earth’s atmosphere caused by a build-up of greenhouse gases that trap heat by allowing sunlight to enter but preventing heat from escaping.\n\n\n\nAn index developed by the U.S. National Climatic Data Center, including variables such as: much-above-normal temperature, high precipitation in cool months, extreme drought in warm months, a higher-than-normal proportion of annual precipitation falling on heavy-rain days, and reduced temperature variability.\n\n\n\nMeasures the gross agricultural emissions of carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O), expressed in CO₂ equivalents.\n\n\n\nA colourless, odourless, and non-poisonous greenhouse gas produced through the decomposition of organic matter in soils under oxidizing conditions and by the burning of fossil fuels.\n\n\n\nThe release of carbon dioxide gases and/or their precursors into the atmosphere over a specified area and period.\n\n\n\nA measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases based on their global warming potential. For example, one million metric tons of methane is equivalent to 21 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over 100 years.\n\n\n\nAn instrument for environmental cost internalization. It is an excise tax on producers of raw fossil fuels based on their relative carbon content.\n\n\n\nThe process by which countries or other entities aim to achieve a low-carbon economy or by which individuals aim to reduce their carbon consumption.\n\n\n\nFinely divided solids or liquids—such as soot, dust, fumes, mists, or aerosols—dispersed in air from combustion, industrial activities, or natural sources.\n\n\n\nSevere disruption in the normal functioning of a community or society due to hazardous physical events interacting with vulnerable conditions, causing significant adverse effects and requiring emergency response.\n\n\n\nThe overflowing of a water body or accumulation of water in normally dry areas. Types include river floods, flash floods, urban floods, pluvial floods, sewer floods, coastal floods, and glacial lake outburst floods.\n\n\n\nA prolonged period of abnormally dry weather causing serious hydrological imbalance. Definitions vary based on precipitation impact on activities such as agriculture (agricultural drought), water supplies (hydrological drought), or meteorology (meteorological drought). A mega-drought is an exceptionally long and pervasive drought, usually lasting a decade or more.\n\n\n\nThe set of capacities needed to generate and disseminate timely and meaningful warning information to enable preparedness and response by those threatened by a hazard.\n\n\n\nA functional unit consisting of living organisms, their non-living environment, and the interactions between them. Ecosystem boundaries and components vary depending on the purpose of analysis, and ecosystems can range from very small to the entire biosphere.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA direct estimator uses data from a survey exclusively from an area to estimate an indicator for that area (i.e., the estimate is produced using only survey data). When the precision of the direct estimate is not adequate, oversampling within the domain or applying statistical techniques that allow reliable estimates in the domain may be necessary.\n\n\n\nThe population for which the survey is designed, for example, households or persons living in a specific county or region.\n\n\n\nRefers to the level at which a measurement is taken—for example, persons, households, farms, or establishments.\n\n\n\nThe information of interest to be captured by the survey, for example, consumption expenditure.\n\n\n\nVariables that affect the variables of interest, for example, age, education, sex, religion, etc.\n\n\n\nA domain or area is defined as the subdivision for which estimations are desired. These can be planned domains (e.g., counties) or unplanned designs (e.g., sub-counties). “Areas” can be geographic or socio-economic delimitations or the result of cross-tabulating the two. Examples include geographic areas (state, county, school district, health service area), socio-demographic groups, or both (e.g., a specific age-sex-race group within a large geographic area), or other subpopulations (e.g., a set of firms belonging to a census division by industry group).\n\n\n\nSmall area estimation is a set of methods used to achieve estimates of acceptable quality for publication. As statistical information is disaggregated into smaller population subgroups, it becomes noisier and yields larger coefficients of variation (CV), which may exceed the threshold established by the National Statistical Offices (NSO), above which they may choose not to publish that specific estimate.\n\n\n\nModel-based small area estimates rely on statistical models to establish a relationship between a dependent variable and a set of covariates. The covariates and parameters obtained from the fitted model are then used to predict the dependent variable in the auxiliary data. In the context of small area estimates of poverty under unit-level models, the dependent variable is typically consumption, expenditure, or income, and the method relies on properly replicating the welfare distribution.\n\n\n\nIn small area estimation methodologies, area-level models use only aggregate auxiliary information at the area level. Aggregated data are more readily available because they are typically not subject to confidentiality restrictions.\n\n\n\nUnit-level models refer to models where detailed unit-record data are available—for example, detailed income/expenditure information from household surveys and a set of household-level characteristics available in both a household survey and a population census—to simulate household expenditures or incomes for each household in the population census data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharges to users of wireless networks based on a flat rate or on the actual time used. In cellular/PCS networks, charges are typically time-based.\n\n\n\nRefers to a television set that is not connected to either a free-to-air set-top box or a pay TV decoder and is thus not able to receive digital signals.\n\n\n\nComputer programs (instructions) that accomplish specific tasks for which people use computers, other than just running the computer system.\n\n\n\nThe amount of data that can be carried from one point to another in a given time period (usually a second).\n\n\n\nGrouping various telecommunications services—wireline and/or wireless—into a package to increase appeal to potential customers and reduce advertising, marketing, and other costs associated with delivering multiple services. For example, a bundled package could include long distance, cellular, Internet, and paging services.\n\n\n\nThe proportion of households with an ICT item is calculated by dividing the number of in-scope households with an ICT item by the total number of in-scope households.\n\n\n\nThe sum total of possible connections (and therefore calls) on telecommunications networks (fixed and wireless).\n\n\n\nA terrestrial radio-based service providing two-way communications by dividing the service area into a regular pattern of sub-areas or cells, each with a base station having a low-power transmitter and receiver. Although primarily used for mobile telephone service, cellular radio is also used to provide data services, private voice services, and as an alternative to fixed wired telephone service in areas with limited infrastructure.\n\n\n\nUsers of portable telephones subscribing to an automatic public mobile telephone service that provides access to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) using cellular technology.\n\n\n\nA spread spectrum air interface technology used in some digital cellular, personal communications services, and other wireless networks.\n\n\n\nA computer is an electronic device that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations. It can store, retrieve, and process data, and is capable of performing a wide range of tasks by executing sequences of instructions called programs. Modern computers are digital, meaning they operate using binary code (0s and 1s) to represent and manipulate data. They do not include devices with embedded computing capabilities such as mobile cellular phones, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), or TV sets.\n\n\n\nThe knowledge and ability a person has to use computers and technology efficiently. It also refers to a person’s comfort level in using computer programs and other applications associated with computers.\n\n\n\nOrganized collections of computer data and instructions, typically categorized into system software and application software.\n\n\n\nData dissemination is the process of releasing and distributing data to users.

In this way, the life cycle of products is extended. In practice, it implies reducing waste to a minimum. When a product reaches the end of its life, its materials are kept within the economy wherever possible through recycling. These materials can be productively used again and again, thereby creating further value. In essence, the circular economy is a system where materials never become waste and nature is regenerated.\n\n\n\nThe Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE) refers to forms of economic activities and relations that prioritize social and often environmental objectives over profit motives. It involves citizens acting collectively and in solidarity to democratize the economy and society, including producers, workers, and consumers.

    "text": "The inalienable rights to which a person is entitled merely for being human. Human rights are built on underlying principles of universality, indivisibility, equality, participation, accountability and non-discrimination, and are enshrined in international human rights law, rules of customary international law, national laws and other standards that define them and help to guarantee their full enjoyment.\nInherent claims to social arrangements that protect each and every person from abuses and deprivation that would prevent them from attaining their full potential.\n\n\nThe various human rights monitoring mechanisms of the United Nations system. These include UN Charter-based bodies (including the Human Rights Council, Universal Periodic Review and special procedures) and treaty-based bodies created under the international human rights treaties (known as treaty bodies).\n\n\n\nA conceptual framework underpinning human development and humanitarian action that is normatively based on international human rights standards and operationally directed to promoting and protecting human rights. A human rights-based approach identifies rights-holders and their entitlements and corresponding duty-bearers and their obligations, and works towards strengthening the capacities of rights-holders to make their claims and of duty-bearers to meet their obligations. It is not only about achieving human rights goals and outcomes, but also about achieving them through a participatory, inclusive, nondiscriminatory, transparent and responsive process.\n\n\n\nDocuments that form the primary legal basis of United Nations activities to promote, protect and monitor human rights and fundamental freedoms. These include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(ICCPR).\n\n\n\nLimitations placed by States on the exercise of certain human rights where they have valid reasons to do so, such as to protect the rights and freedoms of others, for national security, or to protect public health or morals. The burden falls upon States to prove that a limitation imposed upon the enjoyment of the right is legitimate.\n\n\n\nThose human rights which cannot be subjected to limitations or suspensions under any conditions, including in times of public emergency. They include the right to life; the right not to be subjected to torture, or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; freedom from slavery and servitude; freedom of thought, conscience and religion. These rights are also known as peremptory norms of international law or jus cogens norms.\n\n\n\nA core principle of international human rights and refugee law that prohibits States from returning individuals in any manner whatsoever (whether directly or indirectly) to territories where they may be at risk of persecution, torture, or other forms of serious or irreparable harm.\n\n\n\nA State institution established by Law or Constitution with a broad mandate to promote and protect human rights. NHRIs are independent institutions that function without interference from the State or any other stakeholders.\n\n\n\nThese are deaths for which there are reasonable grounds to believe that they resulted directly from acts of war and that the acts, decisions and/or purposes that caused these deaths were in furtherance of, or under the guise of armed conflict.\n\n\n\nThese are individuals who observe, document, analyze and document events, statements, policies, and other developments that may impact society. Their primary role is to collect, verify, organize, and report information in order to inform the public or specific sectors of society. This definition encompasses not only professional full-time reporters and analysts, but also media workers, support staff, community media practitioners, and citizen journalists who temporarily take on journalistic roles. It also includes bloggers and others who engage in self-publication through print, online platforms, or other media channels. Regardless of the medium or employment status, journalists share the common purpose of providing fact-based information and analysis to contribute to an informed society.\n\n\n\nIndividuals exercising their right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of their interests.\n\n\n\nAn association of workers organized to protect and promote their common interests.\n\n\n\nIndividuals who, alone or in association with others, exercise their rights to promote and strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at both national and international levels. This category may include certain journalists and trade unionists. While the term “human rights advocate” is often used synonymously, “human rights defender” is preferred as it aligns more closely with internationally agreed human rights standards and established practice.\n\n\n\nAny extrajudicial or unlawful execution carried out by State actors or by other actors with the State’s permission, support, or acquiescence, motivated by the victim or someone associated with the victim engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender; or committed while the victim was undertaking such activities. This also includes killings by individuals or groups not supported by the State when the act was motivated by the victim’s engagement in such activities and/or was met with a lack of due diligence by the State in responding to the harm, with such inaction motivated by the victim’s or associate’s role.

This applies when the pain or suffering is inflicted by, or with the consent, instigation, or acquiescence of, a public official or someone acting in an official capacity.\n\n\n\nThe arrest or detention of a person that is not in accordance with national laws either because it lacks a legal basis or does not follow established legal procedures and is motivated by the victim’s or an associate’s engagement in activities as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender. It is considered arbitrary when it is inappropriate, unjust, unreasonable, or unnecessary under the circumstances.\n\n\n\nThe unlawful detention, abduction, or confinement of a person without their consent by individuals or groups not acting with the State’s support or acquiescence, where the State fails to exercise due diligence in responding to the incident. Such failure is motivated by the victim’s or an associate’s engagement in activities as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender.\n\n\n\nOther actions by State actors or by individuals acting with the State’s permission, support, or acquiescence that cause or intend to cause harm, and that are motivated by the victim’s role as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender.\n\n\n\nReported cases that include a minimum set of relevant information about the individuals and circumstances involved, and have been reviewed by mandated bodies or mechanisms, which found reasonable grounds to believe that the individuals were victims of human rights violations or abuses.\n\n\n\nAny distinction, exclusion, restriction, or preference either direct or indirect based on prohibited grounds, with the intent or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment, or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis in the political, economic, social, cultural, or other public spheres.\n\n\n\nA form of discrimination based on prohibited grounds, which may involve words, gestures, or actions that annoy, alarm, demean, intimidate, belittle, humiliate, or embarrass another person, or create a hostile or offensive environment.

    "text": "Gender statistics refer to statistics that adequately reflect differences and inequalities between women and men in all areas of life. Gender statistics are more than just statistics about women or sex-disaggregated data. They include:\n· Sex-disaggregated data;\n· Data pertaining specifically to women or men;\n· Data capturing gender issues, even if they do not explicitly mention gender, sex, or women and men.\n\n\nGender is a socio-cultural construct that defines and determines the roles, responsibilities, entitlements, and limitations of women, men, girls, and boys in society. It influences their societal position and varies across time, space, and context. Gender refers to the roles and expectations assigned by society, not biology.\n\n\n\nSex refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that distinguish females and males. These characteristics are natural, unlike gender, which is socially constructed and shaped by historical, cultural, and relational contexts.\n\n\n\nGender analysis examines how differences in roles, responsibilities, needs, opportunities, and rights affect women, men, girls, and boys. It analyzes their constraints and the impacts of these differences to inform policies and programs. This analysis highlights gender gaps and supports equitable development planning.\n\n\n\nThese are socially constructed relationships between women and men in a given cultural context. They differ from biological distinctions and influence power dynamics, access to resources, and social positioning.\n\n\n\nGender issues refer to challenges, opportunities, and barriers affecting both women and men, girls and boys. They are not synonymous with women’s issues.\n\n\n\nThis is the process of incorporating gender considerations into planning and development initiatives. It acknowledges that programs affect women/girls and men/boys differently. The use of sex-disaggregated data is essential in policymaking, planning, budgeting, and decision-making.\n\n\n\nGender inequality refers to unequal access to resources, opportunities, and benefits for women and men. It hinders individual development, national growth, and societal progress.\n\n\n\nGender statistics reflect the socio-cultural realities of women, men, girls, and boys. They include sex-disaggregated data and other statistics relevant to gender-related issues.\n\n\n\nData categorized separately for males and females. This disaggregation is essential for identifying inequalities and conducting effective gender analysis.\n\n\n\nData that are broken down by sex and other variables such as age, location, ethnicity, disability, socio-economic status, and education. These distinctions help reveal hidden inequalities.\n\n\n\nData focused exclusively on women, often used to highlight their situation. However, they do not allow for comparisons with men and cannot fully reveal gender gaps.\n\n\n\nBias arising from decisions or assumptions based on gender, often favoring men or boys over women or girls.\n\n\n\nAssigning specific attributes, characteristics, or roles to individuals solely based on their gender. Stereotyping becomes harmful when it limits opportunities or choices, particularly in education, careers, or personal development.\n\n\n\nThe condition in which women and men, girls and boys have equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities. Gender equality ensures that individuals can realize their full potential without discrimination based on gender.\n\n\n\nMeasures used to assess progress toward gender equality. These may be quantitative (e.g., statistics, figures) or qualitative (e.g., perceptions, experiences).\n\n\n\nThe principle of fairness in treatment for women and men, accounting for different needs, interests, and experiences. It may require special measures to address historic or systemic disadvantages.\n\n\n\nThe measurable difference between women and men in terms of access to opportunities, resources, and participation in various sectors.\n\n\n\nStatistical differences, often called gaps, between men and women that reflect unequal conditions or outcomes.\n\n\n\nGender parity is a numerical measure that reflects relative equality in terms of the number and proportion of women and men, or girls and boys. It is commonly calculated as the ratio of female to male values for a given indicator. When the ratio is calculated as male to female instead, the term “sex ratio” is used rather than “gender parity.”\n\n\n\nThe Gender Parity Index (GPI) measures the relative access to education of female and male students. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of females to the number of males enrolled at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of education.\n\n\n\nThe GDI is a tool used to measure gender inequalities in the social, cultural, economic, and political spheres. It assesses gender gaps in human development across three key dimensions:\n\n  Health – measured by female and male life expectancy at birth;\nEducation – measured by female and male expected years of schooling for children and mean years of schooling for adults aged 25 and above;\n Economic resources – measured by estimated earned income for females and males.\n\n\n\n\nGender blindness refers to the failure to recognize that the roles and responsibilities of women/girls and men/boys are socially and culturally constructed. Gender-blind studies, programs, projects, policies, and attitudes maintain the status quo, overlooking diverse needs and roles, and therefore fail to transform unequal gender relations.\n\n\n\nGender roles are social and behavioral norms that a given culture considers appropriate for individuals of a specific sex. These roles often determine traditional tasks and responsibilities assigned to women, men, boys, and girls, and are shaped by factors such as household structure, access to resources, the global economy, conflict, disasters, and local ecological conditions.\n\n\n\nGender norms are the accepted attributes and behaviors associated with male and female identities in a specific society or community at a particular point in time. They establish standards and expectations of how men and women should act. Internalized early in life, gender norms influence lifelong gender socialization and stereotypes.\n\n\n\nGender planning is an approach that acknowledges the different roles of women and men in society and recognizes that their needs often differ.\n\n\n\nThese are the requirements necessary for women and men to improve their status or position in society. Addressing strategic gender needs enables individuals to move beyond restrictive social roles. For women, these needs may include land rights, decision-making power, equal pay, and access to credit.\n\n\n\nGender relations are a specific subset of social relations that define interactions between men and women as social groups. These relations intersect with other social influences—such as age, ethnicity, race, and religion—to shape individuals’ status and identity. As social constructs, gender relations can be changed.\n\n\n\nGender balance refers to equal participation of women and men in all areas of work and within programs initiated or supported by institutions. Achieving gender balance creates a more inclusive environment, enhances policy and program effectiveness, and strengthens institutional capacity to serve the entire population.\n\n\n\nIt’s the awareness of gender differences and the willingness to adjust and adapt policies, programs, or actions accordingly. It is closely related to gender sensitivity.\n\n\n\nTaking a gender perspective involves considering gender-based differences in any social phenomenon, policy, or process. It emphasizes differences in status and power and examines how gender-based discrimination shapes both immediate needs and long-term interests. In policymaking, a gender perspective ensures that women’s and men’s experiences are equally considered in the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of programs and policies.\n\n\n\nGender mainstreaming is the systematic integration of a gender perspective into the preparation, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of policies, regulations, and spending programs, with the aim of promoting gender equality and eliminating discrimination.\n\n\n\nThis involves the systematic consideration of gender issues and the elimination of gender-based bias throughout all stages of statistical production.\n\n\n\nAll procedures involving the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.\n\n\n\nAll acts of physical, sexual, psychological, or economic violence occurring within the family or domestic setting. This applies regardless of biological or legal ties and includes violence between current or former spouses or partners, whether or not they share a residence.\n\n\n\nAn umbrella term for any harmful act perpetrated against a person based on socially ascribed gender differences. GBV varies across cultures and regions and includes sexual violence, domestic violence, trafficking, forced or early marriage, harmful traditional practices (e.g., FGM, honor killings, widow inheritance), and more. These acts may occur in both public and private settings.\n\n\n\nThese refer to the unique opportunities, challenges, and constraints that affect women and girls. Due to inadequate representation at decision-making levels, their needs are often overlooked or inadequately addressed.\n\n\n\nThe WID approach highlights the marginalization of women in development processes. It advocates for the inclusion of women in development initiatives to ensure that they benefit equally from resources and interventions.\n\n\n\nRefers to enhancing the personal, political, social, or economic strength of individuals and communities. Women’s empowerment enables them to gain control over their lives through increased awareness, confidence, choice, access to resources, and transformation of discriminatory structures and institutions.\n\n\n\nRefers to enabling women to participate equally in and benefit from decent work, social protection, market access, and control over resources, time, and decision-making. It also involves increasing women’s voice, agency, and participation in economic decisions at all levels, from the household to international institutions.",

    "text": "A person with a disability is someone who has a long-term physical, psychological, intellectual, or sensory impairment which, in interaction with various barriers, may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.\n\n\n\nDisability cash benefits refer to financial payments made to individuals who are fully or partially unable to engage in gainful employment due to a disability. The disability may be congenital or acquired as a result of an accident or illness during the individual’s lifetime. These benefits do not include those resulting from prescribed industrial accidents or occupational diseases, which are classified under occupational injury and disease. The provision of goods and services in kind is categorized under services for the elderly and persons with disabilities.\n\n\n\nStateless persons are individuals who are not recognized as nationals by any state under the operation of its laws; either because they never acquired a nationality or because they lost it without obtaining a new one.\n\n\n\nThis refers to stateless individuals who have never crossed an international border but remain in their “own country”- a place where they have long-standing and significant ties, usually through birth or long-term residence. Their statelessness is often the result of shortcomings in the design or implementation of nationality laws.\n\n\n\nIndigenous peoples are communities, groups, or individuals who are descended from the original inhabitants of a country or region, and who retain distinct social, cultural, economic, and political characteristics. They often maintain their own languages, traditions, customs, and institutions and have a strong connection to ancestral lands and natural resources. Indigenous peoples typically identify themselves as such and are recognized by others as belonging to distinct cultural groups. Despite their diversity, they frequently face challenges related to marginalization, land rights, and preservation of cultural heritage.\n\n\n\nA guardian is an independent adult who safeguards a child’s best interests and general well-being and complements the child’s limited legal capacity.\n\n\n\nAn unaccompanied child is one who has been separated from both parents and other relatives and is not being cared for by an adult who, by law or custom, is responsible for doing so.\n\n\n\nAlternative care refers to arrangements made for children who are temporarily or permanently deprived of their family environment or whose best interests require placement outside their family.\n\n\n\nAs stated in Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC): “In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.”\n\n\n\nJustice for children refers to a United Nations framework and set of guiding principles aimed at ensuring that justice systems better serve and protect children. It promotes full adherence to international norms and standards for all children who come into contact with justice or related systems, whether as victims, witnesses, alleged offenders, or for matters involving care, custody, or protection.\n\n\n\nJuvenile justice is a justice system designed specifically for children or young persons who are considered juveniles under the respective legal system. It ensures that offenses committed by juveniles are addressed in a manner distinct from how adult offenses are treated. Age limits defining juveniles vary by country.\n\n\n\nAccording to the United Nations, an older person is someone aged 60 years or older. However, in many communities, age is also determined by socio-cultural markers such as family status (e.g., being a grandparent), physical appearance (e.g., grey hair, wrinkles), or age-related health conditions.\n\n\n\nThere is no universally agreed international definition of “youth.” For statistical purposes, however, the United Nations defines youth as individuals between the ages of 15 and 24 years, without prejudice to definitions adopted by individual Member States.\n\n\n\nThis term traditionally refers to all individuals for whom the UNHCR is mandated to provide protection, assistance, and durable solutions. It includes refugees, asylum-seekers, refugee returnees, stateless persons, and—in many situations—internally displaced persons (IDPs), including those supported by State and non-State partners.",

    "text": "Living conditions are the circumstances or factors affecting the way in which people live, particularly with regard to their well-being. The term ‘living conditions’ is closely related to that of ’quality of life.\nPoverty is a state or condition in which an individual lacks the financial resources and essentials for a basic standard of living.\n\n\nWelfare analysis, in economics, is the study of how policies or market changes affect the well-being of individuals and society, primarily by measuring the net benefits to consumers and producers.\n\n\n\nPoverty is a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, such as food, clean water, shelter, education, and healthcare (monetary and non-monetary). It typically results from a lack of access to resources or opportunities to improve one’s economic situation. Poverty is often measured by income levels, with individuals or households falling below a certain income threshold considered to be in poverty. However, poverty also encompasses other dimensions, including social exclusion, lack of access to essential services, and limited opportunities for economic and social advancement.\n\n\n\nHousehold expenditure refers to the total spending by a person living alone or a group of people living together on goods and services within a specific time period.\n\n\n\nHousehold consumption is the quantity of goods and services that the household enjoys in a given period.\n\n\n\nHousehold consumption expenditure includes those money outlays directed toward consumption (e.g., it excludes outlays for investment purposes).\n\n\n\nData used in analysis refers to the specific information, collected and prepared, that is subjected to various techniques and methods to extract meaningful insights, support decision-making, and draw conclusions. It encompasses raw data that has been organized, cleaned, and potentially transformed to make it suitable for analysis.\n\n\n\nThe recall period in an interview refers to the specific timeframe that respondents are asked to remember or reflect upon when providing information. It is a key aspect in survey design, especially in interviews related to data collection on behaviors, expenditures, or experiences.\nIn an interview about household income, the recall period might be “the last month” or “the past year,” and respondents would be asked to report their income or expenditures during that specific period. The choice of recall period is important because it affects the accuracy and reliability of the responses. If the recall period is too long, respondents may forget details or provide inaccurate information. If it is too short, the information might not capture enough relevant data to make meaningful conclusions.\n\n\n\nRecall interviews with a 7-day recall period are used for the collection of food consumption data, as this method provides a good balance between accuracy and cost-effectiveness.\n\n\n\nRecall interviews with a 1-month recall period are used for the collection of frequent non-food consumption data.\n\n\n\nRecall interviews with a 6-month recall period are used for the collection of less frequent non-food consumption data.\n\n\n\nRecall interviews with a 1-year recall period are used for the collection of durable goods consumption data.\n\n\n\nThe computation of a consumption-based welfare measure consists of assembling the so-called nominal consumption aggregate (NCA) from survey data. NCA is defined as the value of all goods and services consumed by members of the household during the reference period (see Household Consumption Expenditure).\n\n\n\nAll surveys should collect data on all main modes of food acquisition, namely:\na) Purchases;\nb) Household’s own production; and\nc) Received in kind/gifts, etc.\n\n\n\nFood from own production includes products usually sold as part of a household’s main commercial enterprise that are instead reserved for consumption (farm households are a typical example), as well as non-commercial and subsistence food production, and food acquired from hunting, fishing, and gathering.\n\n\n\nFood received in kind in the form of transfers from other households, the private sector, or the government.\n\n\n\n“Food away from home” generally refers to food prepared away from home, regardless of whether the food is consumed outside or inside the home. This includes meals and snacks purchased from restaurants and other commercial establishments (including takeout meals), received in-kind at school, at work, from other households, etc.\n\n\n\nThe non-food non-durable items of the non-food component of the NCA will include all the items in Division 03 “Clothing and Footwear” through to Category 13 “Personal Care, Social Protection, and Miscellaneous Goods,” referencing the Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP), the international reference classification of household expenditures (United Nations, 2018).\n\n\n\nThe durable goods/items of the non-food component of the NCA include those defined by their durability—meaning their ability to deliver useful services through repeated use over an extended period. Examples include automobiles, household appliances, and electronic devices.\n\n\n\nHedonic rent imputation is a method used in economic analysis to estimate the value of housing or real estate, accounting for attributes that influence price, such as location, size, amenities, and condition. The “hedonic pricing model” assumes the price of a good (in this case, housing) is determined by the sum of the values of its individual characteristics.\n\n\n\nAdjusting for price variation refers to accounting for differences in prices over time or across locations when comparing economic data, such as income, expenditure, or living standards. This adjustment—using either Paasche or Laspeyres price deflators—eliminates the influence of price changes or regional disparities to enable like-for-like comparisons.\n\n\n\nThis refers to modifying economic indicators (such as income or expenditure) to account for differences in the number and characteristics of household members (e.g., age, gender) using equivalence scales or consumption needs.\n\n\n\nA description of how the extent of poverty varies across sub-groups of a given population, characterized by gender, geographical location, type of economic activity, income source, etc.\n\n\n\nThe poverty line is a monetary threshold determined at a specific time and location, representing the minimum level of income or consumption expenditure required to meet basic needs, including food, housing, clothing, and healthcare.\n\n\n\nThe food poverty line represents the minimum monetary threshold in Kenyan Shillings required to meet nutritional needs based on consumption patterns. It is calculated based on food that provides 2,250 Kcal per adult equivalent per day, over a 30-day period.\n\n\n\nThe monetary threshold in Kenyan Shillings required to purchase a combination of food and non-food items per adult equivalent per month.\n\n\n\nIndividuals (or households, if estimated at the household level) whose food consumption per adult equivalent falls below the food poverty line in rural or urban areas are considered food poor or in “food poverty.”\n\n\n\nIndividuals (or households) whose total (food and non-food) consumption per adult equivalent falls below the overall poverty line are considered in “overall poverty.”\n\n\n\nIndividuals (or households) whose total consumption per adult equivalent is below the food poverty line are considered in “hardcore poverty.”\n\n\n\nThe proportion of individuals (or households) whose total consumption falls below the poverty line. It is the most commonly used measure of poverty due to its simplicity and ease of interpretation.\n\n\n\nThe poverty gap index measures the average shortfall from the poverty line as a percentage. It reflects the mean distance of the poor from the poverty line, with those above the line considered to have zero shortfall. It also indicates the minimum cost to eliminate poverty under perfect targeting.\n\n\n\nThis index squares each poverty gap before averaging, placing greater weight on the poorest. It accounts for inequality among the poor. Proposed by Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (1984), it is part of a class of poverty measures varying the weight of deprivation severity.\n\n\n\nThe Gini coefficient measures inequality in consumption expenditure. A value of 0 indicates perfect equality, while a value of 100 indicates maximum inequality (i.e., one individual has all the expenditure).\n\n\n\nA measure of poverty that considers factors beyond income, such as education, health, and living standards.",

    "text": "Climate change refers to any significant change in the measures of climate lasting for an extended period of time. In other words, climate change includes major changes in temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns, among others, that occur over several decades or longer. It is attributed directly or indirectly to human (anthropogenic) activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere. The term is frequently used in reference to global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activities.\n\n\nRefers to the condition of the atmosphere at a particular location (microclimate) or region over a long period of time. It is the long-term summation of atmospheric elements – such as solar radiation, temperature, humidity, precipitation type (frequency and amount), atmospheric pressure, and wind (speed and direction) – and their variations.\n\n\n\nWeather is the state of the atmosphere of a given place at a given time. The elements of weather include, but are not limited to, rainfall, temperature, pressure, wind, cloud cover, and humidity.\n\n\n\nThe totality of all the external conditions (physical, biological, and socio-economic) affecting the life, development, and survival of an organism.\n\n\n\nA numerical representation of the climate system based on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of its components, their interactions, and feedback processes, and accounting for some of its known properties. The climate system can be represented by models of varying complexity; that is, for any one component or combination of components, a spectrum or hierarchy of models can be identified, differing in such aspects as the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to which physical, chemical, or biological processes are explicitly represented, or the level at which empirical parametrizations are involved.\n\n\n\nA probabilistic statement about future climate conditions on timescales ranging from seasons to decades. It is based on conditions known at present and assumptions about the physical processes that will determine future changes. When a projection is branded “most likely,” it becomes a prediction, and outputs of which can enable some level of confidence to be attached to projections.\n\n\n\nThe simulated response of the climate system to a scenario of future emissions or concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols, generally derived using climate models. Projections provide a potential future evolution of a quantity or set of quantities, often computed with the aid of a model. Climate projections are distinguished from climate predictions by their dependence on the emission/concentration/radiative forcing scenario used, which is, in turn, based on assumptions concerning, for example, future socio-economic and technological developments that may or may not be realized. Unlike predictions, projections are conditional on assumptions concerning such future developments.\n\n\n\nThe iterative processes for managing change within complex systems in order to reduce disruptions and enhance opportunities associated with climate change.\n\n\n\nThe potential for consequences from climate variability and change where something of value is at stake and the outcome is uncertain. Often represented as the probability that a hazardous event or trend occurs multiplied by the expected impact. Risk results from the interaction of vulnerability, exposure, and hazard.\n\n\n\nVariations in the mean state and other statistics (e.g., standard deviations, occurrence of extremes) of the climate across all spatial and temporal scales beyond that of individual weather events. Variability may be due to natural internal processes within the climate system (internal variability), or to variations in natural or anthropogenic external forcing (external variability).\n\n\n\nAir pollutants are substances in air that could, at high enough concentrations, harm human beings, animals, vegetation, or material. Air pollutants may consist of solid particles, liquid droplets, gases, or combinations of these forms.\n\n\n\nAir pollution is the presence of contaminant or pollutant substances in the air that do not disperse properly and interfere with human health or welfare, or produce other harmful environmental effects.\n\n\n\nAir pollution control refers to steps taken to maintain a standard of air purity for good public health, protection of plant and animal life and property, visibility, and safe ground and air transportation.\n\n\n\nAn air pollution index (API) is a quantitative measure that describes ambient air quality. The index is obtained by combining figures for various air pollutants into a single measurement.\n\n\n\nAir pollution sources are activities that result in air pollution, including agricultural activities, combustion processes, dust-producing processes, manufacturing activities, nuclear energy-related activities, spray painting, printing, dry cleaning, and so on.\n\n\n\nIndoor air pollution refers to chemical, biological, and physical contamination of indoor air which may result in adverse health effects. In developing countries, the main source is biomass smoke, which contains suspended particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).\n\n\n\nAir quality criteria are guidelines or standards established to protect human health and the environment from the harmful effects of air pollution. These criteria typically define acceptable concentrations of specific pollutants in the ambient (outdoor) air. They are used for various purposes, including public health protection, environmental protection, and urban planning.\n\n\n\nAir quality standards refer to levels of air pollutants prescribed by regulations that may not be exceeded during a specified time in a defined area.\n\n\n\nAn analytical method, using input-output techniques, to describe emissions according to their origin (production, consumption, and imports) and final demand categories (final consumption, capital formation, and exports).\n\n\n\nEmission is the release of pollutants into the atmosphere (usually a gas when referring to climate change) from stationary sources such as smokestacks, other vents, surface areas of commercial or industrial facilities, and mobile sources, such as motor vehicles, locomotives, and aircraft.\n\n\n\nEmission damage refers to the effects of (air) pollution on buildings, monuments, organisms, and ecosystems.\n\n\n\nThe emission factor is the ratio between the amount of pollution generated and the amount of a given raw material processed. It may also refer to the ratio between emissions generated and the outputs of production processes.\n\n\n\nAn emission inventory is a listing, by source, of the amounts of pollutants actually or potentially discharged. Such an inventory is used to establish and put forth emission standards.\n\n\n\nAn emission standard is the maximum amount of polluting discharge legally allowed from a single source, mobile or stationary.\n\n\n\nHybrid flow accounts limited to the description of the uses of fossil fuels and corresponding air emissions.\n\n\n\nThe right to generate, in the course of production activity, a certain amount of specific emissions, for example, greenhouse gases. Emissions permits are a form of intangible non-produced assets.\n\n\n\nOzone (O₃) is a pungent, colourless, toxic gas that contains three atoms of oxygen in each molecule. It occurs naturally at a concentration of about 0.01 parts per million (ppm) of air. Levels of 0.1 ppm are considered toxic. In the stratosphere, ozone provides a protective layer shielding the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. In the troposphere, it is a major component of photochemical smog, which seriously affects the human respiratory system.\n\n\n\nOzone depletion is the destruction of ozone in the stratosphere, where it shields the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Its destruction is caused by chemical reactions in which oxides of hydrogen, nitrogen, chlorine, and bromine act as catalysts.\n\n\n\nThe ozonosphere is the lower region of the stratosphere, 15–25 kilometres above the Earth’s surface, in which there is an appreciable ozone concentration. It is also termed the ozone layer.\n\n\n\nThe aggregate measure of the ozone layer-depleting potential of substances, calculated through the conversion factor of halogenated hydrocarbons that contribute to ozone depletion into CFC-11 equivalents.\n\n\n\nMeasures to control the emissions of greenhouse gases and gases that adversely affect the stratospheric ozone layer (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and halons).\n\n\n\nGlobal warming is a phenomenon believed to occur as a result of the build-up of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. It has been identified by many scientists as a major global environmental threat.\n\n\n\nAn aggregate measure of the contribution to the greenhouse effect of some gases, expressed by converting them into carbon dioxide equivalents.\n\n\n\nGreenhouse gases refer to carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, ozone, and chlorofluorocarbons, occurring both naturally and from human (production and consumption) activities, contributing to the greenhouse effect.\n\n\n\nThe greenhouse effect is the warming of the Earth’s atmosphere caused by a build-up of greenhouse gases that trap heat by allowing sunlight to enter but preventing heat from escaping.\n\n\n\nAn index developed by the U.S. National Climatic Data Center, including variables such as: much-above-normal temperature, high precipitation in cool months, extreme drought in warm months, a higher-than-normal proportion of annual precipitation falling on heavy-rain days, and reduced temperature variability.\n\n\n\nMeasures the gross agricultural emissions of carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O), expressed in CO₂ equivalents.\n\n\n\nA colourless, odourless, and non-poisonous greenhouse gas produced through the decomposition of organic matter in soils under oxidizing conditions and by the burning of fossil fuels.\n\n\n\nThe release of carbon dioxide gases and/or their precursors into the atmosphere over a specified area and period.\n\n\n\nA measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases based on their global warming potential. For example, one million metric tons of methane is equivalent to 21 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over 100 years.\n\n\n\nAn instrument for environmental cost internalization. It is an excise tax on producers of raw fossil fuels based on their relative carbon content.\n\n\n\nThe process by which countries or other entities aim to achieve a low-carbon economy or by which individuals aim to reduce their carbon consumption.\n\n\n\nFinely divided solids or liquids—such as soot, dust, fumes, mists, or aerosols—dispersed in air from combustion, industrial activities, or natural sources.\n\n\n\nSevere disruption in the normal functioning of a community or society due to hazardous physical events interacting with vulnerable conditions, causing significant adverse effects and requiring emergency response.\n\n\n\nThe overflowing of a water body or accumulation of water in normally dry areas. Types include river floods, flash floods, urban floods, pluvial floods, sewer floods, coastal floods, and glacial lake outburst floods.\n\n\n\nA prolonged period of abnormally dry weather causing serious hydrological imbalance. Definitions vary based on precipitation impact on activities such as agriculture (agricultural drought), water supplies (hydrological drought), or meteorology (meteorological drought). A mega-drought is an exceptionally long and pervasive drought, usually lasting a decade or more.\n\n\n\nThe set of capacities needed to generate and disseminate timely and meaningful warning information to enable preparedness and response by those threatened by a hazard.\n\n\n\nA functional unit consisting of living organisms, their non-living environment, and the interactions between them. Ecosystem boundaries and components vary depending on the purpose of analysis, and ecosystems can range from very small to the entire biosphere.",

    "text": "A direct estimator uses data from a survey exclusively from an area to estimate an indicator for that area (i.e., the estimate is produced using only survey data). When the precision of the direct estimate is not adequate, oversampling within the domain or applying statistical techniques that allow reliable estimates in the domain may be necessary.\n\n\n\nThe population for which the survey is designed, for example, households or persons living in a specific county or region.\n\n\n\nRefers to the level at which a measurement is taken—for example, persons, households, farms, or establishments.\n\n\n\nThe information of interest to be captured by the survey, for example, consumption expenditure.\n\n\n\nVariables that affect the variables of interest, for example, age, education, sex, religion, etc.\n\n\n\nA domain or area is defined as the subdivision for which estimations are desired. These can be planned domains (e.g., counties) or unplanned designs (e.g., sub-counties). “Areas” can be geographic or socio-economic delimitations or the result of cross-tabulating the two. Examples include geographic areas (state, county, school district, health service area), socio-demographic groups, or both (e.g., a specific age-sex-race group within a large geographic area), or other subpopulations (e.g., a set of firms belonging to a census division by industry group).\n\n\n\nSmall area estimation is a set of methods used to achieve estimates of acceptable quality for publication. As statistical information is disaggregated into smaller population subgroups, it becomes noisier and yields larger coefficients of variation (CV), which may exceed the threshold established by the National Statistical Offices (NSO), above which they may choose not to publish that specific estimate.\n\n\n\nModel-based small area estimates rely on statistical models to establish a relationship between a dependent variable and a set of covariates. The covariates and parameters obtained from the fitted model are then used to predict the dependent variable in the auxiliary data. In the context of small area estimates of poverty under unit-level models, the dependent variable is typically consumption, expenditure, or income, and the method relies on properly replicating the welfare distribution.\n\n\n\nIn small area estimation methodologies, area-level models use only aggregate auxiliary information at the area level. Aggregated data are more readily available because they are typically not subject to confidentiality restrictions.\n\n\n\nUnit-level models refer to models where detailed unit-record data are available—for example, detailed income/expenditure information from household surveys and a set of household-level characteristics available in both a household survey and a population census—to simulate household expenditures or incomes for each household in the population census data.",

    "text": "The circular economy is a model of production and consumption that involves sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling existing materials and products for as long as possible. In this way, the life cycle of products is extended. In practice, it implies reducing waste to a minimum. When a product reaches the end of its life, its materials are kept within the economy wherever possible through recycling. These materials can be productively used again and again, thereby creating further value. In essence, the circular economy is a system where materials never become waste and nature is regenerated.",

    "text": "Population refers to the totality of all units of interest in a study or investigation at a given time in a given area.\n\n\n Abortion is defined, with reference to the woman, as any interruption of pregnancy before 28 weeks of gestation with a dead foetus. There are two major categories of abortion: spontaneous and induced. Induced abortions are those initiated by deliberate action undertaken with the intention of terminating pregnancy; all other abortions are considered spontaneous.\n\n\n\nAdoption is the legal and voluntary taking and treating of the child of other parents as one’s own in so far as provided by the laws of the country. By means of a judicial process, whether related or not to the adopter, the adopted child acquires the rights and status of a legitimate child.\n\n\n\nAgedependency ratios give the number of economically inactive people in relation to each economically active person. Classifications of economically active and inactive are usually made on the basis of age, with everyone aged less than 15 and everyone aged 65 and over considered economically inactive. The overall dependency ratio can be broken down into constituent parts, giving the child dependency ratio (number of children in relation to each economically active person) and the old-age dependency ratio (number of people aged 65 and over in relation to each economically active person).\n\n\n\nThis is the misreporting/mistating of a person’s age by giving a value which is less or more than actual, either intentionally or unintentionally.\n\n\n\nIt is the proportion of population in a given age group to its adjacent age groups, that is the successive and the preceding age groups.\n\n\n\nAge is the interval of time between the day, month and year of birth and the day, month and year of occurrence of the event expressed in the largest completed unit of solar time such as years for adults and children and months, weeks, days, hours or minutes of life, as appropriate, for infants under one year of age.\n\n\n\nIt is an index that combines both the sex ratio and the age ratio for both males and females to generate a joint score. The score is used to evaluate the quality of age and sex data in population censuses or surveys.\n\n\n\n Refers to the annual number of births to women of a specified age or age group per 1,000 women in that age group.\n\n\n\nThe invalidation or voiding of a marriage by a competent authority, according to the laws of each country, which confers on the parties the status of never having been married to each other.\n\n\n\nIt is the starting or reference population on which population projections are based. In most cases the enumerated population is used as a base population.\n\n\n\nBirth (or parity) order refers to the numerical order of the live birth or foetal death, recorded in relation to all previous pregnancy outcomes of the mother, irrespective of whether the outcome is a live birth or foetal death or whether pregnancies were nuptial or extranuptial.\n\n\n\nRefers to the process of recording a child’s birth. It is a permanent and official record of a child’s existence and provides legal recognition of that child’s identity. It establishes a legal record of where the child was born and who the child’s parents are.\n\n\n\nA burial permit is an official statement authorising the removal of the dead body (corpse) to the cemetery.\n\n\n\nA household whose head and main decision maker or source of livelihood is below the age of 18 years.\n\n\n\nRefers to the life-time fertility experience of women 12 years and above. It is the total number of children a woman has given birth to in her lifetime.\n\n\n\nA cohort is a group of people who experienced the same demographic event during a particular period of time. This will most commonly refer to births during a set period of time, but may also refer to marriages, onset of puberty, migration, first birth etc.\n\n\n\nThis is the proportion of vital events that are registered. It is the number of registered vital events divided by an estimate of the actual number of vital events that occurred in the same population during a specific period of time.\n\n\n\nThese are errors in the characteristics of persons counted, resulting from incorrect reporting or recording or from failure to report.\n\n\n\nThese are non-sampling errors that result from omitting a unit that should have been included, including a unit more than once, or including a unit that should not have been included.\n\n\n\nThe crude divorce rate is the number of divorces occurring among the population of a given geographical area during a given year, per 1,000 mid-year total population of the given geographical area during the same year.\n\n\n\nThe crude marriage rate is the number of marriages occurring among the population of a given geographical area during a given year, per 1,000 mid-year total population of the given geographical area during the same year.\n\n\n\nRefers to births that occurred to a woman in the 12 months before the census or survey date.\n\n\n\n The date of birth is the hour (minute), day, month and year of birth established in order that exact age may be determined in completed years, months, days, hours (minutes) of life as required.\n\n\n\n De facto population consists of all persons who are physically present in the country or area of enumeration at the population and housing census enumeration reference date, whether or not they are usual residents.\n\n\n\nDe jure population consists of all usual residents, whether or not they are present at the time of the population and housing census enumeration.\n\n\n\nDeath is the permanent disappearance of all evidence of life at any time after the occurrence of live birth, i.e., the postnatal cessation of vital functions without capability of resuscitation. This definition excludes foetal deaths.\n\n\n\nIs the household where the husband is not present and the wife becomes the main decision maker in his absence during a survey or census data collection exercise.\n\n\n\nThe collection of basic social, demographic and economic data for all people who will have spent a specified night in the reference area. A de facto census involves counting people who spent a specified night in a household or an institution.\n\n\n\nIs the household where the main decision maker is a female who has never been married or is divorced or is legally separated or widowed during a data collection exercise.\n\n\n\nThe collection of basic social, demographic and economic data for all the people who normally reside in the country. It will exclude visitors from other countries and include residents who will be outside the country at the time of enumeration. At household or institution level the dejure census includes only the usual members. The problem with the dejure census is to define the “usual member” of a household or an institution.\n\n\n\nThe registration of a vital event after the prescribed period denoted in existing laws, rules, or regulations (including any grace period, if one is specified). A late registration is the registration of a vital event after the prescribed time period but within a specified grace period. In Kenya, the grace period is from the third to sixth month following the event.\n\n\n\nThe demographic transition is the process by which populations move from high mortality and fertility rates to low mortality and fertility rates as a country develops from a pre-industrial to an industrialized economic system. This is typically demonstrated through a demographic transition model. As fertility decline often lags behind mortality decline, there is an intermediate phase in the middle of the transition characterised by high growth rates.\n\n\n\nDivorce is the final legal dissolution of a marriage; a separation of husband and wife that confers on the parties the right to remarriage under civil, religious and/or other provisions in accordance with the laws of the country.\n\n\n\nAre those occurring simultaneously in the lives of two individuals, which cannot occur again in the life of either individual without a previous change to his or her status. Those events include marriage, registered partnership, separation, divorce, legal dissolution of registered partnerships and annulment of marriage.\n\n\n\nA dual records system is the simultaneous collection of vital events, mainly births and deaths and the appropriate exposed-to-the-risk population, by two collecting methods which, ideally, are independent of each other:\na) a continuous vital event recording procedure which may be other than the civil registration system; and\nb) a periodic household sample survey conducted in the same geographical area.\nMatching of the events reported by the two procedures provides methods of improving the estimate of the total number of vital events.\n\n\n\nThe duration of a marriage refers to the interval of time between the day, month and year of marriage to date. It is often expressed in completed years.\n\n\n\nThis is a place of abode or residence with a private entrance. There can be many dwelling units within a structure. A dwelling unit may have one or more habitable rooms.\n\n\n\nA person who collects the required information from the enumeration area through interviews or any other method of obtaining information.\n\n\n\nA group of persons who are related by blood, marriage, or adoption and who usually live together in the same household.\n\n\n\nA household whose primary decision-maker or source of livelihood (income) is a woman.\n\n\n\nIs the actual number of live births a woman has had by the end of her reproductive life span (15-49 years).\n\n\n\nFoetal Death is death prior to the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of the period of gestation. Death is indicated by the fact that after such separation, the foetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles.\n\n\n\nHabitable rooms are defined as places/spaces in the dwelling unit that are used mainly for living and exclude stores, granaries, offices, toilets and garages.\n\n\n\nIs the most responsible member of a household who makes key decisions of the household on a day-to-day basis and whose authority is recognized by all members of the household. It could be the father, mother or a child, or any other responsible member within the household.\n\n\n\nIt is an isolated compound with one or more structures, and may be inhabited by one or more households. In most cases, fences, hedges, walls, etc. surround homesteads. A homestead may contain, for example, a hut or a group of huts. A manyatta, thus is considered as a homestead. However, a wall/fence or hedge need not necessarily surround a homestead. For instance, boys’ quarters, garage, kitchen, etc. may be part of a homestead whether or not they are surrounded by a fence/wall, etc.\n\n\n\nA person who normally lives in a household and is either present or temporarily away from the household for a period of less than six months at the time of enumeration. This excludes visitors.\n\n\n\nIs a person or a group of persons who reside in the same homestead or compound but not necessarily in the same dwelling unit. They have the same cooking arrangement and are answerable to the same household head.\n\n\n\nA housing census is the total process of planning, collecting, processing, analysing, disseminating and evaluating statistical data relating to the number and condition of housing units and facilities as available to the households pertaining, at a specified time, to all living quarters and occupants thereof in a country or in a well-delimited part of a country.\n\n\n\nAn illegitimate child is the child of parents who, according to national law or customs, were not married at the time of its birth.\n\n\n\nA judicial (legal) separation is the disunion of married persons according to the laws of each country, without conferring on the parties the right to remarriage.\n\n\n\nA late registration is the registration of a birth or death after the legally specified time period but within a specified grace period. The grace period is usually considered to be six months after the vital event.\n\n\n\nThe formal investing of a person with the status and rights of a person born in wedlock, according to the laws of each country.\n\n\n\nRefers to the total number of children ever born alive during the entire reproductive period of the woman.\n\n\n\nLive Birth is the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, which after such separation breathes or shows any other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached; each product of such a birth is considered live-born.\n\n\n\nA household whose primary decision-maker or source of livelihood (income) is a man.\n\n\n\nAn act, ceremony or process by which the legal relationship of spouses is constituted. The legality of the union may be established by civil, religious or other means as recognized by the laws of each country. Countries may wish to expand the definition to cover civil unions if they are registered. In that case, registered partnership usually refers to a legal construct, entailing registration with the public authorities according to the laws of each country, that becomes the basis for legal conjugal obligations between two persons.\nMatching of the events reported by the two procedures provides methods of improving the estimate of the total number of vital events.\n\n\n\nThese are centres with a population of more than 10,000 but less than 100,000 people.\n\n\n\nRefers to the frequency of marriages between persons of opposite sexes which involve rights and obligations fixed by law or custom.\n\n\n\nThe total number of live births a woman has ever had. Women who have never had a live birth may be referred to as nulliparous. Women who have had one live birth are primiparous, and those with more than one live birth are multiparous.\n\n\n\nThe total process of planning, collecting, processing, analysing, disseminating and evaluating demographic, economic and social data at the smallest geographic level pertaining, at a specified time, to all persons in a country or in a well-delimited part of a country.\n\n\n\nThe increase or decrease of the total population or one of its structural units within a given time interval. The components of change in total population are births, deaths and migration.\n\n\n\nPopulation density is calculated as the total population divided by the total area which that population resides in. It provides a simple measure of the pressure of population on space and resources. Problems may arise when population density is calculated for countries with large areas which are uninhabitable, as it may give an impression of “emptiness” when actually the population is crowded in small areas within the total territory.\n\n\n\nThe arrangement of the population in space at a given time, that is geographically or among the various types of residential areas.\n\n\n\nIt is an estimate of future population by considering changes in a population due to fertility (births), mortality (deaths) and migration.\n\n\n\nA diagram showing the comparison of a human population by sex and age at a given time, consisting of a pair of histograms, one for each sex, laid horizontally in ascending order of age groups with a common base. The diagram is intended to provide a quick overall comparison of the age and sex structure of the population.\n\n\n\nThe total number of persons/units in a specified area at a specified point in time\n\n\n\nThe distribution of the population by sex and age groups\n\n\n\nPopulation momentum refers to the inbuilt potential for growth (or decline) inherent in a population’s age-sex structure. It is the amount a population would increase (or decrease) in size, if the fertility of the population changed immediately to replacement level.\n\n\n\nIs the legal acknowledgement, either voluntarily or compulsorily, of the paternity of a child born out of wedlock.\n\n\n\nA respondent is the person who provides answers to the interviewer or the person who records the answers in a self-administered questionnaire. This person should be mature and well informed about the unit of enumeration and its characteristics.\n\n\n\nAn answer provided by the respondent during an interview/inquiry or the answer recorded by the respondent in a self-administered questionnaire.\n\n\n\nThe disunion of married persons, according to the laws of each country, without conferring on the parties the right to remarry.\n\n\n\nThe number of males per 100 females at birth.\n\n\n\nThe number of males per 100 females in a population.\n\n\n\nRefers to the average number of years lived in the single state by those who ever marry before age 50.\n\n\n\nThese are centres with a population of less than 10,000 people.\n\n\n\nIt is the population that has been adjusted for errors on age due to misreporting to give a more fitting demographic pattern.\n\n\n\nA structure is a freestanding building used for the purposes of residential, business or any other activity.\n\n\n\nThis is the average number of children born alive to a woman during her lifetime if she were to bear children at each age in accordance with the prevailing age-specific fertility rates. It is obtained by summing up all age-specific fertility rates for each year of the childbearing span.\n\n\n\nType of marriage is the type of act, ceremony or process by which the legal relationship of husband and wife is constituted, that is, whether civil, religious or customary.\n\n\n\nThe place at which the person has lived continuously for most of the last 12 months (that is, for at least six months or for at least the last 12 months, not including temporary absences for holidays or work assignments) or intends to live for at least six months.\n\n\n\nVA is a process for diagnosing causes of death based on responses collected from families and/or caregivers to a series of structured questions on the signs and symptoms experienced by the deceased, and their duration. These responses are usually reviewed by a physician to determine the probable cause of death.\n\n\n\nAre those involving a descendant; they comprise adoption, legitimation and recognition.\n\n\n\nA legal document entered in the civil register which attests to the occurrence and characteristics of a vital event.\n\n\n\nThe occurrence of a live birth, death, fetal death, marriage, divorce, adoption, legitimation, recognition of parenthood, annulment of marriage, or legal separation.\n\n\n\nA vital statistical record is a document or form, containing the items of information concerning an individual vital event or a number of vital events of the same type, filled in at the time of registration, to meet the needs of vital statistics compilation.\n\n\n\nIn the context of defining a system as a set of interacting or independent components forming an integrating whole and for the purposes of these principles and recommendations, the vital statistics system’s components are (a) legal registration, (b) statistical reporting of, and (c) collection, compilation, and dissemination of statistics pertaining to vital events. The vital events of interest are live births, adoptions, legitimations, recognition; deaths and fetal deaths; and marriages, divorces, separations, and annulments of marriage.\n\n\n\nThese constitute the collection of statistics on vital events in a lifetime of a person as well as relevant characteristics of the events themselves and of the person and persons concerned.

It also includes non-remunerative work undertaken in an income-producing enterprise (e.g., contributing family workers who do not receive formal pay).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese workers generally own and control the economic unit in which they work, make important decisions, and are not dependent on a single other economic unit for market access.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividuals who own and control incorporated businesses and employ one or more persons on a continuous basis.\n\n\n\nIndividuals who own and control unincorporated businesses (household enterprises) and employ one or more persons on a continuous basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividuals who own and operate incorporated businesses but do not employ any employees on a continuous basis (they might be the sole worker or work with contributing family members).\n\n\n\nIndividuals who operate unincorporated household market enterprises without employing any employees on a continuous basis. This is the traditional “self-employed” category.\n\n\n\nThese workers typically provide labour for another economic unit or person, with less control over their work organization or exposure to economic risk compared to independent workers.\n\n\n\nThis is a new and significant category. It refers to workers who provide labour to others under contractual arrangements that are similar to self-employment, but they are dependent on a single or a limited number of economic units for the organization of their work, income, or access to the market. They often do not employ others and are sometimes referred to as “dependent self-employed” or “false self-employed.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployees whose contracts are of indefinite duration or for a very long or unlimited period.\n\n\n\nEmployees whose contracts are for a specific, limited duration, after which they are expected to terminate.\n\n\n\nEmployees whose contracts are for a very short, often intermittent period, or on an “as needed” basis, typically without benefits associated with more stable employment.\n\n\n\nIndividuals undergoing structured training programs for a specific occupation, receiving remuneration for their work.\n\n\n\nIndividuals who hold a self-employment job in a market-oriented establishment operated by a related person living in the same household, and who are not regarded as partners.

General education includes education programmes that are designed to prepare participants for entry into vocational education but do not prepare for employment in a particular occupation, trade or class of occupations or trades, nor lead directly to a labour market-relevant qualification.\n\n\n\nA specific stage of instruction in initial education usually covered during an academic year. Students in the same grade are usually of similar age. This is also referred to as a ‘class’, ‘cohort’ or ‘year’. School attendance is regular attendance at any regular accredited educational institution or programme, public or private, for organized learning at any level of education.\n\n\n\nThese are those who entered and successfully completed an education programme which is classified as ‘level completion’.\n\n\n\nTotal enrollment in a specific level of education, regardless of age, is expressed as a percentage of the eligible official school-age population corresponding to the same level of education in a given school year.\n\n\n\nTotal number of new entrants into the last grade of primary or secondary education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the population at the intended entrance age to the last grade of primary education or secondary education.\n\n\n\nThe highest grade or level of education which the population 4 years and above have reached or attained.\n\n\n\nOccur as a by-product of day-to-day activities, events or communication that are not designed as deliberate educational or learning activities. Examples may include learning that takes place during the course of a meeting, whilst listening to a radio programme, or watching a television broadcast that is not designed as an education programme.\n\n\n\nForms of learning that are intentional or deliberate but are not institutionalised. It is consequently less organized and structured than either formal or non-formal education. Informal learning may include learning activities that occur in the family, workplace, local community and daily life, on a self-directed, family-directed or socially directed basis.\n\n\n\nIs an educational setting that provides education in non-traditional settings. This school often offers flexible schedules, personalized learning approaches, and may focus on specific interests or skills. An informal school may not adhere to strict curriculum guidelines or educational standards established by government authorities, but they provide valuable educational opportunities tailored to the needs of individual learners. Examples of Informal schools are community-based learning centers, homeschooling arrangements, or alternative education programs that provide education in non-traditional settings.\n\n\n\nThese are schools that have inclusive educational settings where Learners with special needs are included in regular classrooms alongside their typically developing peers. These schools support and accommodate learners with special needs and disabilities to enable them to participate fully in schooling. The schools promote social integration and provide a supportive environment for all learners.\n\n\n\nSchools that offer educational programs based on curricula from other countries (e.g., British-IGCSE, American, International Baccalaureate, etc).\n\n\n\nSystem of education in which learners are imparted with the ability to apply appropriate knowledge and skills to successfully perform a function.

Programmes at this level may have a substantial research component but do not yet lead to the award of a doctoral qualification. Typically, programmes at this level are theoretically-based but may include practical components and are informed by state of the art research and/or best professional practice. They are traditionally offered by universities and other tertiary educational institutions.\n\n\n\nWhich is part of TVET education offers business and professional studies programmes leading to the award of certificates and diplomas in various disciplines.

The said units provide targeted support and services to learners with special needs and disabilities while still allowing them to participate in some general education classes with their peers without special needs and disabilities.\n\n\n\nIt is a measure of the movement of learners from one grade or level of education to another and is usually a crude measure of prospects or opportunities for mobility that exist within the education system.\n\n\n\nIt is a measure of persons enrolled in a certain education level when they are already over-age in comparison to the official age category.\n\n\n\nThe number of children in the population who have attained the official school attendance age based on the national curriculum, whether enrolled in school or not.\n\n\n\nProvides learning for children of age 14-17 and on completion, students sit and receive a Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) qualification. lower secondary education, are typically designed to build on the learning outcomes from primary. Usually, the aim is to lay the foundation for lifelong learning and human development upon which education systems may then expand further educational opportunities. Upper secondary education is typically designed to complete secondary education in preparation for tertiary education or provide skills relevant to employment, or both.\n\n\n\nEducation is designed to facilitate learning by individuals who, for a wide variety of reasons, require additional support and adaptive pedagogical methods in order to participate and meet learning objectives in an education programme. Reasons may include (but are not limited to) disadvantages in physical, behavioural, intellectual, emotional and social capacities. Education programmes in special needs education may follow a similar curriculum as that offered in the parallel regular education system, but they take individual needs into account by providing specific resources (e.g. specially-trained personnel, equipment or space) and, if appropriate, modified educational content or learning objectives. These programmes can be offered to individual students within already-existing education programmes or as a separate class in the same or separate educational institutions.\n\n\n\nThese are schools specifically designed to exclusively cater for learners with special needs or significant learning disabilities. These schools have specialized programs, teaching methods, and support services to address the individual needs of their learners. The curriculum provided in these schools may be adapted to suit the abilities and learning styles of their learners.\n\n\n\nA group of pupils who enter the first grade of a level of education in the same school year and subsequently experience promotion, repetition, drop-out or successful completion, each in his or her own way.\n\n\n\nThe learning experience has the elements of duration and continuity.\n\n\n\nPersons who, in their professional capacity, guide and direct learners in gaining knowledge, attitudes and skills that are stipulated by a defined curriculum programme.\n\n\n\nEducation that offers various technical and vocational courses which include trade test courses in vocational training centres (formerly youth polytechnics), artisan, craft and diploma courses in technical and vocational colleges (formerly technical training institutes and institutes of technology); craft and diploma courses in national polytechnics, the leads to trade tests, certificates and diplomas in various disciplines. This level of education is designed for learners who have completed primary or secondary education and also youth who, for some reason, do not enrol in the regular education system at the primary education level.\n\n\n\nTertiary education builds on secondary education, providing learning activities in specialised fields of education.

These goods and services are referred to as consumer goods and services and their individual value is defined as the consumption expenditure on these goods or services. \n\n\nHousehold income is the sum of money income and income in kind and consists of receipts which, as a rule, are of a recurring nature and accrue to the household or to individual members of the household regularly at annual or at more frequent intervals (ILO,2000). Household income consists of receipts in cash, in kind or in services, that are usually recurrent and regular and are received by the household or by individual members of the household at annual or at more frequent intervals. During the reference period when they are received, such receipts are potentially available for current consumption and, as a rule, do not reduce the net worth of the household (ILO,2001). Income is thus defined in terms of a broad grouping of sources of income as follows:\n\n\n\nIncome from employment comprises receipts from involvement in economic activities, strictly in an employment-related capacity. It consists of employee income (e.g. wages) and self-employment income (return to labour), (ILO, 2000).\n\n\n\nEmployee income consists of direct wages and salaries, cash bonuses and gratuities, commissions, directors’ fees, profit-sharing bonuses and other forms of profit-related pay, remuneration for time not worked (e.g. as sick leave or annual leave), free or subsidized goods and services from an employer as well as severance and termination pay. Employee income can be in cash (in the sense of monetary), in kind as goods or services.\n\n\n\nIncome from self-employment is defined as the income which is received, over a given reference period, by individuals, for themselves or in respect of their family members, as a result of their current or former involvement in self-employment jobs” (ILO 2000). Income from self employment is taken as income received as a result of involvement in a self-employment job. It should be noted that this component is restricted to owners of unincorporated enterprises who work in such enterprises.\n\n\n\nProperty incomeis income received from ownership of financial and other assets, e.g. interest payments. Property income consists of receipts received as a result of ownership of financial and non-financial assets that are provided to others for their use. These are usually in the form of interest receipts, dividends, rents received for the use of unproduced assets (natural resources), royalties for use of intellectual property and rents received for produced assets.\n\n\n\nThis is income from household production of services for own consumption, e.g. services of owner-occupied housing, household production of domestic services for own consumption. These are services produced within the household for the household’s own consumption and not for the market. They include services from owner-occupied dwellings and from consumer durable goods owned as well as own-produced domestic services. They are valued net of expenses that go into their production\n\n\n\nTransfers are receipts for which there is no “quid pro quo”, i.e. nothing tangible is given by the recipient to the donor in return for the receipts. Transfers may be made between households, between households and government or between households and charities. Transfers are mainly  motivated by the intention to redistribute income. Transfers can consist of cash (monetary) or goods or of services and can cross national boundaries. Capital transfers are one-off or irregular and are usually large, lump-sum receipts. In contrast, current transfers usually recur regularly and tend to be small. Current transfers are also mostly available for use in consumption expenditure during the reference period while recipients of capital transfers do not usually regard them as income and do not use them wholly for consumption expenditure during the reference period.\n\n\n\nCurrent transfers whether in cash or goods consist of social security pensions/schemes; pensions and other insurance benefits; current transfers from non-profit institutions and current transfers from other households.\n\n\n\nThese aresocial transfers in kind from government-provided services to individual households such as education, health, social welfare, transport and cultural services.\n\n\n\nHolding gains are changes in the value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities over a reference period which occur without any direct action of the owner, for example, changes in the value of stocks and shares. A holding gain, the result of an increase in assets or a reduction in liability, increases the net worth of the owner’s assets while a loss has the opposite effect.\n\n\n\nThis is the value of consumer goods and services that were acquired (used or paid for) by a household for the direct satisfaction of the needs and wants of its members through direct monetary purchases in the market; through the market-place but without using any money as means of payment (barter, income in kind); or from production within the household (own-account production).\n\n\n\nThis is expenditure incurred on goods including food items, personal care items, fuel, educational and entertainment items,  household items such as cleaning products and so on.\n\n\n\nThis is expenditure on household kitchen appliances, household information and entertainment appliances, other household appliances, household transportation equipment, other household items, clothing items, utensils, and so on. Consumer goods that are used many times over a long period of time without reducing their capacity to satisfy needs and wants are referred to as durable goods.\n\n\n\nIntertemporal consumption refers to how individuals allocate their consumption of goods and services across different time periods, typically balancing consumption today versus in the future. The decision is influenced by factors such as income, interest rates, time preferences, and expectations about the future.\nNet Disposable Income\n\n\n\n\nSocial protection is the systematic intervention intended to relieve households and individuals of the burden of a defined set of social risks. Social protection can be organized as social assistance or social insurance schemes, with the latter organized as social security schemes or employment-related social insurance schemes.” Kenya’s social protection sector is structured into three pillars: social assistance, social security and social health insurance.\n\n\nThese are direct, regular and predictable transfers that raise and smooth incomes to reduce poverty and vulnerability. Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCTs) are for the beneficiary to decide how to spend. Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) are given with the requirement that the beneficiary meets certain conditions – often related to human capital development, such as visiting a health clinic or ensuring children go to school.\n\n\n\nThis Fund was established under Section 28 of the SHIA (2023), and it covers costs related to managing chronic illnesses after the depletion of social health insurance cover and funds emergency treatment. In contrast, NHIF provides general health insurance coverage for various medical needs. The Emergency, Chronic, and Critical Illness Fund has diverse funding sources, including appropriations by the National Assembly, gifts, grants, donations, endowments, or funds from any other lawful source.\n\n\n\nInua Jamii is a cash transfer programme implemented by the Kenyan government to cushion vulnerable members of society and improve their livelihood. The objective of the program is to uplift the lives of poor and vulnerable Kenyans through regular and reliable cash transfers. It represents the first building block towards a universal social protection system in Kenya. The programme is completely funded by the Government and aims to reach all people aged 70 or older who are not already in receipt of a civil service pension, providing them with a monthly cash transfer disbursed every two months.\n\n\n\nThis is a programme that provides a common operating framework to harmonise the delivery of Kenya’s tax-financed social protection schemes.\n\n\n\nThis is a mandatory national scheme whose main objective is to provide basic financial security benefits to Kenyans upon retirement. The Fund was set up as a Provident Fund providing benefits in the form of a lump sum.\n\n\n\nThis is a fund that focuses on procuring primary healthcare services from health facilities. It is funded through various sources, including appropriations by the National Assembly, grants, gifts, donations, bequests, fees, levies, and funds from other relevant sources. SHI aims to remove limitations on specific medical expenses, such as pre-treatment blood works and certain CT scans, and includes coverage for congenital conditions and preventive measures not previously covered.\n\n\n\nThese are programmes that provide jobs on infrastructure projects for cash or food. They are sometimes classified as labour market interventions depending on whether their function is primarily poverty alleviation, job creation, or social protection. In Kenya, such programmes include ‘Kazi Kwa Vijana’.\n\n\n\nThis is a regulatory body established by the Government of Kenya to supervise the establishment and management of retirement benefits schemes in the Republic of Kenya.\n\n\n\nThis is a free nutritious meal at school – usually lunch – and sometimes take-home rations for children most in need. This is a type of in-kind assistance. They help encourage parents to keep children in school.\n\n\n\nThis is direct, regular and predictable cash or in-kind resources transfers to poor and vulnerable individuals or households. It is usually provided by the state and financed by national taxes. Transfers are non-contributory, i.e. the full amount is paid by the provider. Some are targeted based on categories of vulnerability, and some are targeted broadly to low-income groups.\n\n\n\nThis is a State corporation under the Government of Kenya responsible for the provision and management of public health insurance within the Republic of Kenya. The core mandate of the SHA is to provide accessible, affordable, sustainable, and quality health insurance for all Kenyan citizens and, where applicable, foreign residents.\n\n\n\nThis is a social health insurance system in Kenya that is operated through individuals contributing funds to a common pool through regular premiums, deducted from salaries or paid directly, to finance care services for themselves and their dependents. The Social Health Insurance Fund is governed by the Social Health Insurance Act (SHIA) of 2023 and it introduces three funds: Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF), Primary Healthcare Fund and Emergency, Chronic, and Critical Illness Fund.\n\n\n\nThis is a fund aimed at promoting the implementation of universal health coverage by ensuring all individuals and communities receive the health services they need, including the full spectrum of essential, quality health services from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care without suffering financial hardship. The fund has been established by the government to improve the quality of life for all citizens by providing equitable, accessible, affordable, and high-standard healthcare.\n\n\n\nThese are contributory programmes where participants make regular payments to a scheme that will cover costs related to life-course events, for example, maternity, unemployment or illness. Social insurance includes contributory pensions; health, unemployment, or disaster insurance; and funeral assistance. Social insurance is strongly linked to the formal labour market, meaning coverage is often limited to formal workers.\n\n\n\nThese are state pensions, a form of cash transfer targeted by age. Pensions are the most common social protection tool, with the widest global coverage and often highest national spend. The current pensions schemes in Kenya comprise the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) which is a state contributory scheme mandatory for all employers and employees in the formal sector and informal sector workers who can contribute on voluntary basis, Civil Servants Pension Scheme which is non-contributory and administered by The National Treasury for the government for retired civil servants and (iii) private pension schemes.\n\n\n\nDefined as events or circumstances that may adversely affect the welfare of households either by imposing additional demands on their resources or by reducing their income. Needs may occur due to sickness, unemployment, retirement, housing, education, or family circumstances.\n\n\n\nSocial security is defined as the security that the society furnishes through appropriate organizations against certain risks to which its members are exposed. The concept of social security is based on ideas of human dignity and social justice. The underlying idea behind social security measures is that a citizen who has contributed or is likely to con­tribute to his/her country’s welfare should be given protection against certain hazards. The concept of social security, thus, is based on the ideals of human dignity and socio-economic justice. Underlying the concept is also the desire to give protection to its citizens to contribute to a coun­try’s total welfare against certain hazards of life to which they are exposed either in the working life or as a consequence of it.\n\n\n\nThis is a poverty-targeted and household-based programme with the objective of providing regular cash transfers to poor families living with children identified as OVCs to encourage fostering and retention of children and promote their human capital development. OVCs are defined in the programme as children aged 0-17 years old with at least one deceased parent, or a parent who is chronically ill, or whose main caregiver is chronically ill.\n\n\n\nThis is a poverty-targeted and household-based programme that seeks to enhance the capacities of care givers through cash transfers and as such, improve the livelihoods of persons with severe disabilities as well as reduce negative impact of disability on households. It targets adults and children with severe disabilities, who require full time support of a caregiver. The objectives of the programme are to: to strengthen the capacities of parents and children with disabilities; improve the livelihoods of parents and children with disabilities and to alleviate integrated poverty among parents and children with disabilities.\n\n\n\nThis is a poverty-targeted and household-based programme where cash is transferred unconditionally to households in ASALs with the aim of reducing poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition, and promote asset retention and accumulation in poor households.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRefers to the processes and outcomes of the production (construction) and consumption (use) of residential (living) shelters.It includes the physical product, the process that yields the product, and the socio-cultural and environmental circumstances in which the product is developed, delivered and used.

A mobile housing unit may also refer to a moving unit such as a ship, a boat, a caravan, trailers, boats, tents, etc. occupied as living quarters at the time of the census.\n\n\n\nThis is a space in a housing unit enclosed by walls reaching from the floor to the ceiling or roof covering, or to a height of at least 2 metres, of an area large enough to hold a bed for an adult, that is, at least 4 square metres.\n\n\n\nA building where more than 50% of floor space area is not intended for dwelling but for other purposes such as commercial or industrial or for provision of services i.e. factories, office building, government buildings, garages, warehouses, barns etc. It also covers buildings for persons living in institutions, such as hospital buildings, prisons, military establishments and so forth.\n\n\n\nThese are built with durable materials (wall, floor and roof) that can maintain their stability for at least 15 years.\n\n\n\nRefers to water that is usually supplied to households through pipes. The can either be connected from the source to the individual’s stand/plot or from the source to the individual’s housing unit.\n\n\n\nAlso called a household connection, is defined as a water service pipe connected with in-house plumbing to one or more taps (e.g., in the kitchen and bathroom).\n\n\n\nA piped water connection to a tap placed in the yard or plot outside the house.\n\n\n\nA dug well that is protected from runoff water by a well lining or casing that is raised above ground level and a platform that diverts spilled water away from the well.\n\n\n\nA deep hole that has been driven, bored or drilled, with the purpose of reaching groundwater supplies.\n\n\n\nRain that is collected or harvested from surfaces (by roof or ground catchment) and stored in a container, tank or cistern until used.\n\n\n\nThis is a spring that is subject to runoff, bird droppings, or the entry of animals.\n\n\n\nThis is a dug well for which one of the following conditions is true: 1) the well is not protected from runoff water; or 2) the well is not protected from bird droppings and animals. If at least one of these conditions is true, the well is unprotected.\n\n\n\nThis refers to water sold by a provider who transports water into a community. The types of transportation used include donkey carts, motorized vehicles and other means.\n\n\n\nThis refers to surface water is water located above ground and includes rivers, dams, lakes, ponds, streams, canals, and irrigation channels.\n\n\n\nThe spring is typically protected from runoff, bird droppings and animals by a “spring box”, which is constructed of brick, masonry, or concrete and is built around the spring so that water flows directly out of the box into a pipe or cistern, without being exposed to outside pollution.\n\n\n\nThe water is trucked into a community and sold from the water truck.\n\n\n\n\nThe charge for use of land, buildings or other real property, payable by a tenant to a landlord at regular intervals, usually monthly.\n\n\nA building for which the major part (more than 50% of its gross floor area) is built for dwelling purposes, i.e. for habitation of households.\n\n\n\nA space in a housing unit or other living quarters enclosed by walls reaching from the floor to the ceiling or roof covering, or at least to a height of 2 metres, of a size large enough to hold a bed for an adult, that is at least 4 square metres.

It might be seen as a built-up and compact human settlement with a population of at least 2,000 people. An urban centre may be classified as a market centre, town, municipality or city. Urban centres are also service centres that provide goods and services to both the resident and surrounding population. As such, an urban centre may constitute some trading centres with less than 2,000 people.\n\n\n\nThis is the process of concentration of a country’s national population into settlements designated as urban centres. It’s the process whereby a society is transformed from an essentially rural to a predominantly urban one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCulture is a set of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features of society or a social group that encompasses not only art and literature, but lifestyles, ways of living together, value systems, traditions and beliefs (UNESCO, 2001). Whereas it is not always possible to measure such beliefs and values directly, it is possible to measure associated behaviours and practices.\nCulture plays a key role in all societies around the world, influencing various facets of peoples’ lives, from leisure to professional activities.\n\n\n\nAre measures undertaken to extend the life of cultural heritage while strengthening transmission of its significant heritage messages and values (ICCROM, 1998). In the domain of cultural property, the aim of conservation is to maintain the physical and cultural characteristics of the object to ensure that its value is not diminished and that it will outlive our limited time span (UNESCO, 1988).\n\n\n\nThis is one of the main branches of intellectual property. It applies to “every production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression. The expression “literary and artistic works” is to be understood, for the purposes of copyright protection, as including every original work of authorship, irrespective of its literary or artistic merit. Literary and artistic works include books, pamphlets and other writings, music, plays, choreography, photography, films, paintings, drawings, architecture, engraving, lithography (WIPO, 2003, 1979).\n\n\n\nThese are defined as “those produced by artisans, either completely by hand or with the help of hand-tools or even mechanical means, as long as the direct manual contribution of the artisan remains the most substantial component of the finished product. The special nature of artisanal products derives from their distinctive features, which can be utilitarian, aesthetic, artistic, creative, culturally attached, decorative, functional, traditional, religiously and socially symbolic and significant” (UNESCO and ITC, 1997).\n\n\n\nThey embody or convey cultural expressions, irrespective of the commercial value they may have. Cultural activities may be an end in themselves or they may contribute to the production of cultural goods and services.\n\n\n\nRefers to the many ways in which the different cultures of groups and societies find expression. These cultural expressions are passed on within and among groups and societies, and from generation to generation. Cultural diversity, however, is evident not only in the varied ways in which cultural heritage is expressed, augmented and transmitted but also in the different modes of artistic creation, production, dissemination, distribution and enjoyment, whatever the means and technologies that are used.\n\n\n\nDefined as consumer goods that convey ideas, symbols and ways of life, i.e. books, magazines, multimedia products software, recordings, films, videos, audio-visual programmes, crafts and fashion.\n\n\n\nThis includes artefacts, monuments, a group of buildings and sites that have a diversity of values including symbolic, historic, artistic, aesthetic, ethnological or anthropological, scientific and social significance (UNESCO, 1972). Cultural industries produce and distribute cultural goods or services as defined above.\n\n\n\nRepresents combined works of nature and humans, and they express a long and intimate relationship between people and their natural environment (UNESCO, 2007).\n\n\n\nThis is participation in the arts and everyday life activities that may be associated with a particular culture. It refers to “the ways in which ethnically-marked differences in cultural tastes, values and behaviours inform not just artistic and media preferences but are embedded in the daily rhythms of different ways of life; and of the ways in which these connect with other relevant social characteristics – those of class and gender, for example” (Bennett, 2001).\n\n\n\nThis is participation in the arts and everyday life activities that may be associated with a particular culture. It refers to “the ways in which ethnically-marked differences in cultural tastes, values and behaviours inform not just artistic and media preferences but are embedded in the daily rhythms of different ways of life; and of the ways in which these connect with other relevant social characteristics – those of class and gender, for example” (Bennett, 2001).\n\n\n\nConsists of units mainly engaged in the creative, artistic and aesthetic design of objects, environments and services (ABS, 2001).\n\n\n\nThe process of conceptualizing and creating clothing, footwear, and fashion accessories that reflect aesthetic, cultural, or functional values.

Fashion design is protected under intellectual property frameworks such as industrial design and copyright\n\n\n\nCarried out by companies or individuals engaged primarily in the design of graphic material for the purposes of display or publication.\n\n\n\nPeoples are persons in independent countries who are regarded as “indigenous” on account of their descent from the populations which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the country belongs, at the time of conquest or colonisation or the establishment of present state boundaries and who, irrespective of their legal status, retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions” (ILO, 1989).\n\n\n\nDefined as “the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognise as part of their cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity” (UNESCO, 2003).\n\n\n\nDefined as media where either i) two or more objects have an effect on one another; ii) the user can effect a change on an object or within the environment (users playing videos games); iii) they involve active participation of a user; or iv) there is two way effect as opposed to one way or simple cause effect (Canadian Heritage, 2008).\n\n\n\nActivities carried out by companies and individuals engaged primarily in the design of interior environments of buildings, private and public, residential and commercial (Statistics New Zealand, 1995).\n\n\n\nCovers the design of lands and gardens for human use. Usually, this relates to the design of and adjacent to buildings, either private or public, but the design can also relate to large public areas such as parks and reserves (Statistics New Zealand, 1995).\n\n\n\nThis is an organisation, or part of an organisation, whose main aims are to build and maintain a collection and to facilitate the use of such information resources and facilities as are required to meet the informational, research, educational, cultural or recreational needs of its users; these are the basic requirements for a library and do not exclude any additional resources and services incidental to its main purpose (ISO, 2006). It includes any organized collection of books and periodicals in electronic or in printed form or of any other graphic or audio-visual materials (adapted from UNESCO, 1970). It includes virtual libraries, digital catalogues.\n\n\n\nA non-profit, permanent institution in the service of society and its development, open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits the tangible and intangible heritage of humanity and its environment for the purposes of education, study and enjoyment.\na. The above definition of a museum shall be applied without any limitation arising from the nature of the governing body, the territorial character, the functional structure or the orientation of the collections of the institution concerned.\nb. In addition to institutions designated as ‘museums’ the following qualify as museums for the purposes of this definition:\ni. natural, archaeological and ethnographic monuments and sites and historical monuments and sites of a museum nature that acquire, conserve and communicate material evidence of people and their environment;\nii. institutions holding collections of and displaying live specimens of plants and animals, such as  botanical and zoological gardens, aquaria and vivaria;\niii. science centres and planetaria;\niv. non-profit art exhibition galleries\nv. nature reserves; conservation institutes and exhibition galleries permanently maintained by libraries and archives centres; natural parks;\nvi. international or national or regional or local museum organisations, ministries or departments or public agencies responsible for museums as per the definition given under this article;\nvii. non-profit institutions or organisations undertaking conservation research, education, training, documentation and other activities relating to museums and museology;\nviii. cultural centres and other entities that facilitate the preservation, continuation\nand management of tangible or intangible heritage resources (living heritage and digital creative activity); and\nix. such other institutions as the Executive Council, after seeking the advice of the Advisory Committee, considers as having some or all the characteristics of a museum, or as supporting museums and professional museum personnel through museological research, education or training (ICOM 2007).\n\n\n\nThis consists of natural features, geological and physiographical formations and delineated areas that constitute the habitat of threatened species of animals and plants and natural sites of value from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty. It includes nature parks and reserves, zoos, aquaria and botanical gardens (UNESCO, 1972).\n\n\n\nRefers to professional or amateur performing arts activities, such as theatre, dance, opera and puppetry, as well as the celebration of cultural events (festivals, feasts and fairs), which occur locally and can be informal in nature.\n\n\n\nThe aim of preservation is to prevent damage liable to be caused by environmental or accidental factors, which pose a threat in the immediate surroundings of the object to be conserved. Accordingly, preventive methods and measures are not usually applied directly but are designed to control the microclimatic conditions of the environment with the aim of eradicating harmful agents or elements, which may have a temporary or permanent influence on the deterioration of the object (UNESCO, 1988).\n\n\n\nDefined as an activity undertaken for pleasure or relaxation that diverts amuses or stimulates.\n\n\n\nConsists of companies and individuals mainly engaged in the presentation or provision of sports and physical recreation and associated services. Coaching and education services related to sports and physical recreation are included. Also included are business units, which manufacture wholesale or retail sports and physical recreation goods.\n\n\n\nRefers to the knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities around the world. Developed from experience gained over the centuries and adapted to the local culture and environment, traditional knowledge is transmitted orally from generation to generation. It tends to be collectively owned and takes the form of stories, songs, folklore, proverbs, cultural values, beliefs, rituals, community laws, local language and agricultural practices, including the development of plant species and animal breeds. Traditional knowledge is mainly of a practical nature, particularly in such fields as agriculture, fisheries, health, horticulture, forestry and environmental management in general” (SCBD, 2007).\n\n\n\nPersons in independent countries whose social, cultural and economic conditions distinguish them from other sections of the national community, and whose status is regulated wholly or partially by their own customs or traditions or by special laws or regulations.\n\n\n\nAppeal primarily to the visual sense; they are art forms that focus on the creation of works, which are primarily visual in nature, or are multidimensional objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe average time spent in an activity can be computed either with reference to the whole population of the category or specifically to those who participated in the activity. Therefore, the participation rate for the activity is required, and two series of tables are presented:\n1.       Average time spent per day by the population and\n2.     Average time spent per day by persons who engaged in the activity.\nBasic time use statistics typically provide estimates of the average time spent per day on various types of activities by individuals within specific demographic groups. These categories may include men, women, boys, and girls within certain age groups, as well as distinctions such as rural or urban residence, employment status, and more. To ensure accurate averages, time use data should encompass both weekdays and weekends, and account for seasonal variations throughout the year.\n\n\n\nThe participation rate refers to the proportion of individuals in the survey population who took part in a specific activity during the reference period, such as in  the last 24 hours.\n\n\n\nA one-hour interval within a 24-hour period during which respondents reported one or more activities.\n\n\n\nSimultaneous activities are those undertaken by the same person at the same time and place. For instance: cooking while listening to the radio, or cleaning the house while caring for the children etc.\n\n\n\nActivities within the SNA production boundary include the production of goods and services supplied or intended to be supplied to others, own-account production of goods retained by producers, own-account production of housing services by owner-occupiers and of domestic and personal services produced in a household by paid domestic staff.\nThe SNA excludes unpaid household activities that produce domestic or personal services for consumption within the same household, except when performed by paid staff.\n\n\n\nNon-SNA include unpaid domestic and personal services produced and consumed within the same household, such as cleaning, maintenance, and repairs, meal preparation and serving, care and instruction of children, care for the sick, elderly, or infirm, transportation of household members or their goods and unpaid volunteer services to other households, communities, or associations\n\n\n\nAn activity is considered non-productive if it cannot be delegated to someone else, according to the “third-person rule.” These include personal maintenance activities such as eating, sleeping, exercising and leisure or recreational activities such as watching TV, playing games and hobbies.\n\n\n\nProductive work refers to activities that can be delegated to another person and still produce the same result. All such activities fall within the general production boundary.\n\n\n\nReproductive work includes activities such as rearing and caring for children; caring for the elderly, ill, disabled and other household members; caring unpaid for non-family members; and cooking, cleaning and fetching water and fuel. Though these activities are productive, they are not included in GDP calculations.\n\n\n\nThis refers to time spent caring for or helping any child (under 18) or adult in the household, regardless of their health status. Care is categorized into:\n\n\n\nTime spent directly and exclusively on a child while not engaged in any other activity, such as feeding, bathing, playing, or helping with homework.\n\n\n\nTime spent directly helping or caring for an adult, such as bathing, grooming, or assisting with household tasks like cleaning or cooking.\n\n\n\nCare provided while engaged in another primary activity. For example, watching over a child doing homework while cooking dinner or watching over a sick parent while doing house chores\n\n\n\nStatistical survey that aims to report data on how people spend their time. If the necessary R&D coefficients cannot be derived from other surveys or administrative data, time-use surveys are the recommended method to derive the necessary informationfor estimating the R&D component of full-time equivalents (FTEs) and expenditures.\n\n\n\nMonitoring or supervising another person without direct interaction. For example, watching children get dressed or supervising a family member taking medication. This may occur while performing other tasks or as a primary activity.\n\n\n\nActive care involves direct interaction with the person being cared for. Examples include helping someone dress or administering medication.\n\n\n\nA statistical framework that estimates the value of unpaid work in the household, such as childcare, adult care, housework, and volunteering. Specifically, the household production satellite accounts show the relation between the monetary value of unpaid work to the total GDP providing relevant information that complements the GDP.\n\n\n\nThese involve performing two or more activities during the same time interval. The primary activity is the one whose value added exceeds that of other activities and it’s deemed most important or requiring the most concentration. The secondary activity is carried out at the same time as the primary activity but considered of lesser importance\n\n\n\nDiaries that capture all activities undertaken by a respondent over a defined reference period (e.g. a full 24-hour period, a weekday and a weekend day, a full week, etc.). They capture start and end times, activity duration, sequence, and frequency.\n\n\n\nA structured system that categorizes activities into groups to analyze how people spend their time. It supports policymaking and statistical reporting through a hierarchical structure that assigns numeric codes to each activity.\n\n\n\nA standard classification of all activities that the general population may engage in over a 24 hours period. The classification provides categories for compiling internationally comparable time-use statistic\nPaid work\nUnpaid work\n\n\n\nan activity is considered productive if it can be delegated to someone else or if it yields an output that is capable of being exchanged.\n\n\n\nActivities performed for personal maintenance and care such as eating, drinking, sleeping, exercising etc. are non-productive or personal activities: these cannot be delegated to a person other than the one benefiting from them. Similarly, activities associated with socializing, entertainment, participation in sports, hobbies and games, and use of mass media are considered non-productive activities."

There are two major categories of abortion: spontaneous and induced. Induced abortions are those initiated by deliberate action undertaken with the intention of terminating pregnancy; all other abortions are considered spontaneous.\n\n\n\nAdoption is the legal and voluntary taking and treating of the child of other parents as one’s own in so far as provided by the laws of the country. By means of a judicial process, whether related or not to the adopter, the adopted child acquires the rights and status of a legitimate child.\n\n\n\nAgedependency ratios give the number of economically inactive people in relation to each economically active person. Classifications of economically active and inactive are usually made on the basis of age, with everyone aged less than 15 and everyone aged 65 and over considered economically inactive. The overall dependency ratio can be broken down into constituent parts, giving the child dependency ratio (number of children in relation to each economically active person) and the old-age dependency ratio (number of people aged 65 and over in relation to each economically active person).\n\n\n\nThis is the misreporting/mistating of a person’s age by giving a value which is less or more than actual, either intentionally or unintentionally.\n\n\n\nIt is the proportion of population in a given age group to its adjacent age groups, that is the successive and the preceding age groups.\n\n\n\nAge is the interval of time between the day, month and year of birth and the day, month and year of occurrence of the event expressed in the largest completed unit of solar time such as years for adults and children and months, weeks, days, hours or minutes of life, as appropriate, for infants under one year of age.\n\n\n\nIt is an index that combines both the sex ratio and the age ratio for both males and females to generate a joint score. The score is used to evaluate the quality of age and sex data in population censuses or surveys.\n\n\n\n Refers to the annual number of births to women of a specified age or age group per 1,000 women in that age group.\n\n\n\nThe invalidation or voiding of a marriage by a competent authority, according to the laws of each country, which confers on the parties the status of never having been married to each other.\n\n\n\nIt is the starting or reference population on which population projections are based. In most cases the enumerated population is used as a base population.\n\n\n\nBirth (or parity) order refers to the numerical order of the live birth or foetal death, recorded in relation to all previous pregnancy outcomes of the mother, irrespective of whether the outcome is a live birth or foetal death or whether pregnancies were nuptial or extranuptial.\n\n\n\nRefers to the process of recording a child’s birth. It is a permanent and official record of a child’s existence and provides legal recognition of that child’s identity. It establishes a legal record of where the child was born and who the child’s parents are.\n\n\n\nA burial permit is an official statement authorising the removal of the dead body (corpse) to the cemetery.\n\n\n\nA household whose head and main decision maker or source of livelihood is below the age of 18 years.\n\n\n\nRefers to the life-time fertility experience of women 12 years and above. It is the total number of children a woman has given birth to in her lifetime.\n\n\n\nA cohort is a group of people who experienced the same demographic event during a particular period of time. This will most commonly refer to births during a set period of time, but may also refer to marriages, onset of puberty, migration, first birth etc.\n\n\n\nThis is the proportion of vital events that are registered. It is the number of registered vital events divided by an estimate of the actual number of vital events that occurred in the same population during a specific period of time.\n\n\n\nThese are errors in the characteristics of persons counted, resulting from incorrect reporting or recording or from failure to report.\n\n\n\nThese are non-sampling errors that result from omitting a unit that should have been included, including a unit more than once, or including a unit that should not have been included.\n\n\n\nThe crude divorce rate is the number of divorces occurring among the population of a given geographical area during a given year, per 1,000 mid-year total population of the given geographical area during the same year.\n\n\n\nThe crude marriage rate is the number of marriages occurring among the population of a given geographical area during a given year, per 1,000 mid-year total population of the given geographical area during the same year.\n\n\n\nRefers to births that occurred to a woman in the 12 months before the census or survey date.\n\n\n\n The date of birth is the hour (minute), day, month and year of birth established in order that exact age may be determined in completed years, months, days, hours (minutes) of life as required.\n\n\n\n De facto population consists of all persons who are physically present in the country or area of enumeration at the population and housing census enumeration reference date, whether or not they are usual residents.\n\n\n\nDe jure population consists of all usual residents, whether or not they are present at the time of the population and housing census enumeration.\n\n\n\nDeath is the permanent disappearance of all evidence of life at any time after the occurrence of live birth, i.e., the postnatal cessation of vital functions without capability of resuscitation. This definition excludes foetal deaths.\n\n\n\nIs the household where the husband is not present and the wife becomes the main decision maker in his absence during a survey or census data collection exercise.\n\n\n\nThe collection of basic social, demographic and economic data for all people who will have spent a specified night in the reference area. A de facto census involves counting people who spent a specified night in a household or an institution.\n\n\n\nIs the household where the main decision maker is a female who has never been married or is divorced or is legally separated or widowed during a data collection exercise.\n\n\n\nThe collection of basic social, demographic and economic data for all the people who normally reside in the country. It will exclude visitors from other countries and include residents who will be outside the country at the time of enumeration. At household or institution level the dejure census includes only the usual members. The problem with the dejure census is to define the “usual member” of a household or an institution.\n\n\n\nThe registration of a vital event after the prescribed period denoted in existing laws, rules, or regulations (including any grace period, if one is specified). A late registration is the registration of a vital event after the prescribed time period but within a specified grace period. In Kenya, the grace period is from the third to sixth month following the event.\n\n\n\nThe demographic transition is the process by which populations move from high mortality and fertility rates to low mortality and fertility rates as a country develops from a pre-industrial to an industrialized economic system. This is typically demonstrated through a demographic transition model. As fertility decline often lags behind mortality decline, there is an intermediate phase in the middle of the transition characterised by high growth rates.\n\n\n\nDivorce is the final legal dissolution of a marriage; a separation of husband and wife that confers on the parties the right to remarriage under civil, religious and/or other provisions in accordance with the laws of the country.\n\n\n\nAre those occurring simultaneously in the lives of two individuals, which cannot occur again in the life of either individual without a previous change to his or her status. Those events include marriage, registered partnership, separation, divorce, legal dissolution of registered partnerships and annulment of marriage.\n\n\n\nA dual records system is the simultaneous collection of vital events, mainly births and deaths and the appropriate exposed-to-the-risk population, by two collecting methods which, ideally, are independent of each other:\na) a continuous vital event recording procedure which may be other than the civil registration system; and\nb) a periodic household sample survey conducted in the same geographical area.\nMatching of the events reported by the two procedures provides methods of improving the estimate of the total number of vital events.\n\n\n\nThe duration of a marriage refers to the interval of time between the day, month and year of marriage to date. It is often expressed in completed years.\n\n\n\nThis is a place of abode or residence with a private entrance. There can be many dwelling units within a structure. A dwelling unit may have one or more habitable rooms.\n\n\n\nA person who collects the required information from the enumeration area through interviews or any other method of obtaining information.\n\n\n\nA group of persons who are related by blood, marriage, or adoption and who usually live together in the same household.\n\n\n\nA household whose primary decision-maker or source of livelihood (income) is a woman.\n\n\n\nIs the actual number of live births a woman has had by the end of her reproductive life span (15-49 years).\n\n\n\nFoetal Death is death prior to the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of the period of gestation. Death is indicated by the fact that after such separation, the foetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles.\n\n\n\nHabitable rooms are defined as places/spaces in the dwelling unit that are used mainly for living and exclude stores, granaries, offices, toilets and garages.\n\n\n\nIs the most responsible member of a household who makes key decisions of the household on a day-to-day basis and whose authority is recognized by all members of the household. It could be the father, mother or a child, or any other responsible member within the household.\n\n\n\nIt is an isolated compound with one or more structures, and may be inhabited by one or more households. In most cases, fences, hedges, walls, etc. surround homesteads. A homestead may contain, for example, a hut or a group of huts. A manyatta, thus is considered as a homestead. However, a wall/fence or hedge need not necessarily surround a homestead. For instance, boys’ quarters, garage, kitchen, etc. may be part of a homestead whether or not they are surrounded by a fence/wall, etc.\n\n\n\nA person who normally lives in a household and is either present or temporarily away from the household for a period of less than six months at the time of enumeration. This excludes visitors.\n\n\n\nIs a person or a group of persons who reside in the same homestead or compound but not necessarily in the same dwelling unit. They have the same cooking arrangement and are answerable to the same household head.\n\n\n\nA housing census is the total process of planning, collecting, processing, analysing, disseminating and evaluating statistical data relating to the number and condition of housing units and facilities as available to the households pertaining, at a specified time, to all living quarters and occupants thereof in a country or in a well-delimited part of a country.\n\n\n\nAn illegitimate child is the child of parents who, according to national law or customs, were not married at the time of its birth.\n\n\n\nA judicial (legal) separation is the disunion of married persons according to the laws of each country, without conferring on the parties the right to remarriage.\n\n\n\nA late registration is the registration of a birth or death after the legally specified time period but within a specified grace period. The grace period is usually considered to be six months after the vital event.\n\n\n\nThe formal investing of a person with the status and rights of a person born in wedlock, according to the laws of each country.\n\n\n\nRefers to the total number of children ever born alive during the entire reproductive period of the woman.\n\n\n\nLive Birth is the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, which after such separation breathes or shows any other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached; each product of such a birth is considered live-born.\n\n\n\nA household whose primary decision-maker or source of livelihood (income) is a man.\n\n\n\nAn act, ceremony or process by which the legal relationship of spouses is constituted. The legality of the union may be established by civil, religious or other means as recognized by the laws of each country. Countries may wish to expand the definition to cover civil unions if they are registered. In that case, registered partnership usually refers to a legal construct, entailing registration with the public authorities according to the laws of each country, that becomes the basis for legal conjugal obligations between two persons.\nMatching of the events reported by the two procedures provides methods of improving the estimate of the total number of vital events.\n\n\n\nThese are centres with a population of more than 10,000 but less than 100,000 people.\n\n\n\nRefers to the frequency of marriages between persons of opposite sexes which involve rights and obligations fixed by law or custom.\n\n\n\nThe total number of live births a woman has ever had. Women who have never had a live birth may be referred to as nulliparous. Women who have had one live birth are primiparous, and those with more than one live birth are multiparous.\n\n\n\nThe total process of planning, collecting, processing, analysing, disseminating and evaluating demographic, economic and social data at the smallest geographic level pertaining, at a specified time, to all persons in a country or in a well-delimited part of a country.\n\n\n\nThe increase or decrease of the total population or one of its structural units within a given time interval. The components of change in total population are births, deaths and migration.\n\n\n\nPopulation density is calculated as the total population divided by the total area which that population resides in. It provides a simple measure of the pressure of population on space and resources. Problems may arise when population density is calculated for countries with large areas which are uninhabitable, as it may give an impression of “emptiness” when actually the population is crowded in small areas within the total territory.\n\n\n\nThe arrangement of the population in space at a given time, that is geographically or among the various types of residential areas.\n\n\n\nIt is an estimate of future population by considering changes in a population due to fertility (births), mortality (deaths) and migration.\n\n\n\nA diagram showing the comparison of a human population by sex and age at a given time, consisting of a pair of histograms, one for each sex, laid horizontally in ascending order of age groups with a common base. The diagram is intended to provide a quick overall comparison of the age and sex structure of the population.\n\n\n\nThe total number of persons/units in a specified area at a specified point in time\n\n\n\nThe distribution of the population by sex and age groups\n\n\n\nPopulation momentum refers to the inbuilt potential for growth (or decline) inherent in a population’s age-sex structure. It is the amount a population would increase (or decrease) in size, if the fertility of the population changed immediately to replacement level.\n\n\n\nIs the legal acknowledgement, either voluntarily or compulsorily, of the paternity of a child born out of wedlock.\n\n\n\nA respondent is the person who provides answers to the interviewer or the person who records the answers in a self-administered questionnaire. This person should be mature and well informed about the unit of enumeration and its characteristics.\n\n\n\nAn answer provided by the respondent during an interview/inquiry or the answer recorded by the respondent in a self-administered questionnaire.\n\n\n\nThe disunion of married persons, according to the laws of each country, without conferring on the parties the right to remarry.\n\n\n\nThe number of males per 100 females at birth.\n\n\n\nThe number of males per 100 females in a population.\n\n\n\nRefers to the average number of years lived in the single state by those who ever marry before age 50.\n\n\n\nThese are centres with a population of less than 10,000 people.\n\n\n\nIt is the population that has been adjusted for errors on age due to misreporting to give a more fitting demographic pattern.\n\n\n\nA structure is a freestanding building used for the purposes of residential, business or any other activity.\n\n\n\nThis is the average number of children born alive to a woman during her lifetime if she were to bear children at each age in accordance with the prevailing age-specific fertility rates. It is obtained by summing up all age-specific fertility rates for each year of the childbearing span.\n\n\n\nType of marriage is the type of act, ceremony or process by which the legal relationship of husband and wife is constituted, that is, whether civil, religious or customary.\n\n\n\nThe place at which the person has lived continuously for most of the last 12 months (that is, for at least six months or for at least the last 12 months, not including temporary absences for holidays or work assignments) or intends to live for at least six months.\n\n\n\nVA is a process for diagnosing causes of death based on responses collected from families and/or caregivers to a series of structured questions on the signs and symptoms experienced by the deceased, and their duration. These responses are usually reviewed by a physician to determine the probable cause of death.\n\n\n\nAre those involving a descendant; they comprise adoption, legitimation and recognition.\n\n\n\nA legal document entered in the civil register which attests to the occurrence and characteristics of a vital event.\n\n\n\nThe occurrence of a live birth, death, fetal death, marriage, divorce, adoption, legitimation, recognition of parenthood, annulment of marriage, or legal separation.\n\n\n\nA vital statistical record is a document or form, containing the items of information concerning an individual vital event or a number of vital events of the same type, filled in at the time of registration, to meet the needs of vital statistics compilation.\n\n\n\nIn the context of defining a system as a set of interacting or independent components forming an integrating whole and for the purposes of these principles and recommendations, the vital statistics system’s components are (a) legal registration, (b) statistical reporting of, and (c) collection, compilation, and dissemination of statistics pertaining to vital events. The vital events of interest are live births, adoptions, legitimations, recognition; deaths and fetal deaths; and marriages, divorces, separations, and annulments of marriage.\n\n\n\nThese constitute the collection of statistics on vital events in a lifetime of a person as well as relevant characteristics of the events themselves and of the person and persons concerned. Vital statistics provide crucial and critical information on the population in a country.\n\n\n\nRefers to population age 15-34 for training and age 15-24 as used in enrolment for international comparison. In Kenya, youth are persons aged 18-34."

According to direction of the balance, it may be characterized as net in-migration or net out-migration. Thus, net flow in or out is indicated by a plus (+) or minus (-) sign.\n\n\n\nA document issued by the competent authority of a State, valid for international travels, which identifies the holder as a national of the issuing State and constitutes evidence of the holder’s right to return to that State.\n\n\n\nA non-national with the right of permanent residence in a State of destination.\n\n\n\nThis is movement in the recent past of persons enumerated during the census, relative to their previous place of residence a year prior to census.

This is the traditional focus of labour force statistics. e.g. Employees (permanent, temporary, casual), self-employed individuals (employers, own-account workers), contributing family workers who receive direct pay or a share of profits.\n\n\n\nWork performed to produce goods or provide services mainly or exclusively for the household’s or family’s own final use. This activity must satisfy the “third-person criterion” (i.e., it must be possible for someone else to perform the activity on one’s behalf). e.g.\na)     Production of goods: Growing food for household consumption (subsistence farming), fetching water, collecting firewood, constructing or maintaining one’s own dwelling, manufacturing goods for household use (e.g., clothes, furniture) and\nb)    Provision of services: Childcare, care for dependent adults, cooking, cleaning, and other domestic tasks within one’s own household.\n\n\n\nWork performed for others without pay, primarily to acquire workplace experience or skills. e.g. Unpaid internships, apprenticeships (where no pay or significant remuneration is received beyond perhaps a small stipend for expenses), or traineeships.\n\n\n\nNon-compulsory work performed for others without pay, driven by a desire to help others, contribute to communities, the environment, or support organizations. e.g. Volunteering for a charity, community service, helping a neighbour without payment, environmental clean-up efforts.\n\n\n\nA residual category for work activities that do not fit into the other four forms. This can include unpaid compulsory work (e.g., community service as a legal requirement, work for traditional communal obligations). e.g. prison labour (if unpaid)\n\n\n\nAll persons aged 15 years and older. This is the potential pool of labour. It includes individuals who are employed, unemployed, or outside the labour force (e.g., students, homemakers, retirees).\n\n\n\nAll individuals of working age who, during a short reference period (typically one week), either worked for pay or profit for at least one hour, or were temporarily absent from a job in which they had already worked, due to reasons like sick leave, vacation, or maternity/paternity leave.\n\n\n\nAll working-age persons who were not in employment, carried out activities to seek employment during a specified recent period and were currently available to take up employment given a job opportunity. Note: individuals engaged in unpaid or own-use production work (like subsistence farming) are not considered unemployed, even if they want paid work. Instead, they may fall outside the labour force or potential labour force categories\n\n\n\nThis comprises all persons of working age who furnish the supply of labour for the production of goods and services during a specified time-reference period. It refers to the sum of all persons of working age who are employed and those who are unemployed.\n\n\n\nIt is the proportion of a country’s working-age population that is employed.\n\n\n\nThe labour force participation rate is the proportion of the working-age population that is in the labour force.\n\n\n\nThisincludes working-age persons neither in employment nor in unemployment.\n\n\n\nA person “not in employment” and “currently available” who does not “seek employment” because he or she has already made arrangements to start a job within a short subsequent period, set according to the general length of waiting time for starting a new job in the national context but generally not greater than three months.\n\n\n\nThisrefers to mismatches between labour supply and demand, which translate into an unmet need for employment among the population. There are several measures of labour underutilization including unemployment, time-related underemployment, the potential labour force, and the LU1-LU4 rates.\n\n\n\nThis is defined as all persons in employment who wanted to work additional hours, whose working time in all jobs was less than a specified hours threshold, and who were available to work additional hours given an opportunity for more work.\n\n\n\nThis is a subset of persons outside the labour force, which aims to measure the potential supply of labour, or in other words, it quantifies all persons with an unmet need for income-generating work and provides a measure of their degree of labour market integration. It includes persons who are either looking for a job but not currently available to work, or who are available to work but are not actively looking for a job.\n\n\n\nThis is defined as the sum of the potential labour force and the labour force. It includes persons of working age who, during the short reference period, were neither in employment nor in unemployment and: (a) carried out activities to “seek employment”, were not “currently available” but would become available within a short subsequent period (i.e. unavailable jobseekers); or (b) did not carry out activities to “seek employment”, but wanted employment and were “currently available” (i.e. available potential jobseekers).\n\n\n\nThis includes all working-age persons who were not in employment, carried out activities to seek employment during a specified recent period and were currently available to take up employment given a job opportunity.\n\n\n\nThis is the share of the labour force that is unemployed.\n\n\n\nThis represents the share of the labour force that is either in unemployment or time-related underemployment.\n\n\n\nThis represents the share of the extended labour force that is in unemployment or the potential labour force.\n\n\n\nThis represents the share of the extended labour force that is in unemployment, time-related underemployment, or the potential labour force.\n\n\n\nThis is a situation of the unemployed population where the duration of employment search is 12 months or more, including the reference period.\n\n\n\nUnemployment varies predictably with the season. Cyclical unemployment is associated with a reduction in real output and occurs during a recession.\n\n\n\nFormal sector enterprises are economic units that are formally constituted, recognized, and regulated by government authorities. They operate within the scope of national legal and regulatory frameworks, including those related to taxation, business registration, labour laws, and social security. Their primary objective is typically the production of goods and services for the market to generate income or profit, or for non-profit purposes, or non-market production for government/public use.\n\n\n\nInformal sector enterprises are unincorporated household enterprises that are not formally constituted, recognized, or regulated by government authorities, or are not sufficiently covered by formal arrangements in law or in practice. Their production of goods and services is primarily intended for the market with the purpose of generating income and profit, but they operate outside or insufficiently within formal legal and regulatory frameworks.\n\n\n\nThis refers to households acting as employers for individuals performing domestic services (e.g., housekeepers, nannies, gardeners) for remuneration. The employment relationship for these domestic workers can be either formal or informal. The “household” in this context is the employer unit, not an “enterprise” in the typical business sense, nor is the work itself usually considered “own-use production” as it’s for remuneration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTypically involves working a standard number of hours per week (e.g., 35-40 hours), with a regular schedule and consistent pay. Often comes with benefits like health insurance, paid leave, and retirement plans.\n\n\n\nThis involves working fewer hours than full-time employees, often with flexible schedules. Pay is usually on a pro-rata basis, and benefits may or may not be included.\n\n\n\nHighly flexible, “as-needed” basis, without guaranteed hours or long-term commitment. Payment is often daily or per task, and typically without standard benefits. It does not provideengagements for a period longer than 90 days. They have no formal employment contract with the employer and their services may be terminated with or without notice.\n\n\n\nWork for a limited period, often project-based, seasonal, or to cover absences. May be direct hires or through staffing agencies.\n\n\n\nHired for a specific project, task, or defined timeframe, with a start and end date specified in the contract. Often treated as self-employed for tax purposes.\n\n\n\nWork opportunities available only during specific times of the year when demand for goods or services peaks (e.g., agriculture, tourism, retail during holidays).\n\n\n\nIndividuals who work for themselves, offering services to multiple clients or operating their own business. They control their own work, manage their taxes and benefits, and are not employees of a company.\n\n\n\nShort-term work or training opportunities designed for students or new graduates to gain practical experience, often for little or no pay, or for academic credit.\n\n\n\nA structured training program that combines on-the-job learning with formal education or classroom instruction, typically for skilled trades. Apprentices earn a salary while learning.\n\n\n\nShort-term, task-based jobs are often facilitated through digital platforms (e.g., ride-sharing, food delivery, online freelance tasks). Characterized by flexibility but often lacks traditional employee benefits and job security.\n\n\n\nFormal employment refers to work arrangements that are recognized, regulated, and protected by existing legal and regulatory frameworks. Workers in formal employment typically have explicit (written or oral) contracts, defined working conditions, and access to social protection and benefits. Primarily occurs within formal sector enterprises (businesses and organizations that are registered with tax authorities, operate under legal frameworks, and adhere to regulations).\n\n\n\nInformal employment refers to all remunerative work (both self-employment and wage employment) that is not registered, regulated, or protected by existing legal or regulatory frameworks, and therefore lacks access to social protection and employment benefits. It also includes non-remunerative work undertaken in an income-producing enterprise (e.g., contributing family workers who do not receive formal pay).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese workers generally own and control the economic unit in which they work, make important decisions, and are not dependent on a single other economic unit for market access.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividuals who own and control incorporated businesses and employ one or more persons on a continuous basis.\n\n\n\nIndividuals who own and control unincorporated businesses (household enterprises) and employ one or more persons on a continuous basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndividuals who own and operate incorporated businesses but do not employ any employees on a continuous basis (they might be the sole worker or work with contributing family members).\n\n\n\nIndividuals who operate unincorporated household market enterprises without employing any employees on a continuous basis. This is the traditional “self-employed” category.\n\n\n\nThese workers typically provide labour for another economic unit or person, with less control over their work organization or exposure to economic risk compared to independent workers.\n\n\n\nThis is a new and significant category. It refers to workers who provide labour to others under contractual arrangements that are similar to self-employment, but they are dependent on a single or a limited number of economic units for the organization of their work, income, or access to the market. They often do not employ others and are sometimes referred to as “dependent self-employed” or “false self-employed.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployees whose contracts are of indefinite duration or for a very long or unlimited period.\n\n\n\nEmployees whose contracts are for a specific, limited duration, after which they are expected to terminate.\n\n\n\nEmployees whose contracts are for a very short, often intermittent period, or on an “as needed” basis, typically without benefits associated with more stable employment.\n\n\n\nIndividuals undergoing structured training programs for a specific occupation, receiving remuneration for their work.\n\n\n\nIndividuals who hold a self-employment job in a market-oriented establishment operated by a related person living in the same household, and who are not regarded as partners.

It involves communication designed to bring about learning.\nThe terms defined below are used in computing statistics and indicators on education and training in Kenya\n\n\nThe annual teaching or examination period during which students attend courses or take final examinations, not taking minor breaks into account. It may be shorter than 12 months but would typically not be shorter than 9 months. It may vary for different levels of education or types of educational institutions within a country. This is also referred to as the ‘school year’, mainly for the pretertiary level.\n\n\n\nNumber of pupils of the school-age group for primary education, enrolled either in primary or secondary education expressed as a percentage of the total population in that age group.\n\n\n\nNumber of students of the school-age group for secondary education, enrolled either in secondary or post-secondary education expressed as a percentage of the total population in that age group.\n\n\n\nEducation is specifically targeted at individuals who are regarded as adults by their society to improve their technical or professional qualifications, further develop their abilities, enrich their knowledge with the purpose to complete a level of formal education, or to acquire, refresh or update their knowledge, skills and competencies in a particular field. This also includes what may be referred to as ‘continuing education’, ‘recurrent education’ or ‘second chance education’.\n\n\n\nPersons above 18 years who can read and write meaningfully with understanding in any language.\n\n\n\nEnrollment of a specific single age enrolled, irrespective of the level of education, as a percentage of the population of the same age.\n\n\n\nEvaluation of an individual’s achievement of learning objectives, using a variety of assessment methods (written, oral and practical tests/examinations, projects and portfolios) during or at the end of an education programme.\n\n\n\nThis is a program designed to impart basic skills to learners and refers to adult education classes.\n\n\n\nOften designed to provide participants with intermediate academic and/or professional knowledge, skills and competencies, leading to a first degree or equivalent qualification. Programmes at this level are typically theoretically-based but may include practical components and are informed by state of the art research and/or best professional practice. They are traditionally offered by universities and equivalent tertiary educational institutions.\n\n\n\nPercentage of pupils in each level of education (primary and secondary education) who are at least 2 years above the intended age for their grade.\n\n\n\nA relationship between two or more persons or an inanimate medium and persons, involving the transfer of information (messages, ideas, knowledge, strategies, etc.). Communication may be verbal or non-verbal, direct/face-to-face or indirect/remote, and may involve a wide variety of channels and media.\n\n\n\nParticipation in all components of an education programme (including final examinations if any), irrespective of the result of any potential assessment of achievement of learning objectives.\n\n\n\nPercentage of a cohort of children or young people aged 3-5 years above the intended age for the last grade of each level of education who have completed that grade. It is a measurement of delay in the completion of a level of education.\n\n\n\nCovers all levels of basic education from pre-primary education and includes university education. The new system comprises 2 years of pre-primary education, 6 years of primary education (3 years lower primary and 3 years upper primary), 6 years of secondary education (3 years junior secondary and 3 years senior secondary) and 3 years of university education.\nThe official school-going age for pre-primary education under CBC is age 4-5 years while that of primary education is age 6-11 years, secondary education is 12-17 years and 18 years and above for university education.\n\n\n\nA unit of instruction comprising a sequence of educational activities in a particular field or range of related fields of education. This can also be referred to as a ‘module’, ‘unit’ or ‘subject’.\n\n\n\nUnit in which the successful completion of courses or modules is earned and documented during and at the end of an education programme. Credits express the volume of learning based on a typical workload needed to achieve the expected learning objectives.\n\n\n\nEducational qualification awarded upon successful completion of specific education programmes in tertiary education (traditionally by universities or equivalent institutions).\n\n\n\nAre designed primarily to lead to an advanced research qualification. Programmes at this ISCED level are devoted to advanced study and original research and are typically offered only by research-oriented tertiary educational institutions such as universities. Doctoral programmes exist in both academic and professional fields.\n\n\n\nProportion of pupils from a cohort enrolled in a given grade at a given school year who are no longer enrolled in the following school year. The analysis of the 2019 Census data has computed the dropout rate as the proportion of the population that left school before completion to those who ever attended school before completion of the primary or secondary education cycle.\n\n\n\nProgrammes that combine school- or college- and work- based education. Both components are substantial (i.e. go beyond a single internship or occasional class), although the work-based part usually occupies 50% of the programme time or more.\n\n\n\nProvides pre-primary schooling for children of age 4-5 years under the level of Early Years of Education. Early childhood education is typically designed with a holistic approach to support children’s early cognitive, physical, social and emotional development and introduce young children to organized instruction outside of the family context.\n\n\n\nA coherent set or sequence of educational activities designed and organized to achieve pre-determined learning objectives or accomplish a specific set of educational tasks over a sustained period. Within an education programme, educational activities may also be grouped into sub-components variously described in national contexts as ‘courses’, ‘modules’, ‘units’ and/or ‘subjects’. A programme may have major components not normally characterised as courses, units or modules – for example, play-based activities, periods of work experience, research projects and the preparation of dissertations.\n\n\n\nAn organization that provides education, either as a main or ancillary objective. This can be a public educational institution, as well as a private enterprise, non-governmental organization or non-educational public body.\n\n\n\nThe overall network of institutions and programmes through which education of all types and/or all levels is provided to the population.\n\n\n\nDeliberate activity involving some form of communication intended to bring about learning.\n\n\n\nIs the highest ISCED (International Standard Classification of Education) level successfully completed by an individual.\n\n\n\nEstablished institution that provides education as its main purpose, such as a school, college, university or training centre. Such institutions are normally accredited or sanctioned by the relevant national education authorities or equivalent authorities. Educational institutions may also be operated by private organizations, such as religious bodies, special interest groups or private educational and training enterprises, both for profit and non-profit.\n\n\n\nThe highest level of formal training attained by an individual. In Kenya there are three levels of formal education namely primary, secondary and tertiary.\n\n\n\nIndividuals officially registered in a given education programme, or stage or module thereof, regardless of age.\n\n\n\nEducation that is institutionalized, intentional and planned through public organizations and recognized private bodies and in their totality constitute the formal education system of a country. Formal education consists mostly of initial education and in Kenya, it is offered at pre-primary, primary, secondary to university (including middle-level colleges) and it is normally provided as a continuous ‘ladder’ of full-time education.\n\n\n\nIt is a structured educational institution that follows a standardized curriculum, has defined policies and procedures, and is typically recognized and regulated by government authorities. This school has a clear organizational structure, qualified teachers, and facilities dedicated to teaching and learning. Learners attending a formal school will usually progress through grades or levels, leading to recognized qualifications or certifications upon completion.\n\n\n\nEducation programmes that are designed to develop learners’ general knowledge, skills and competencies, as well as literacy and numeracy skills, often to prepare participants for more advanced education programmes at the same or a higher ISCED level and to lay the foundation for lifelong learning. These programmes are typically school- or college-based. General education includes education programmes that are designed to prepare participants for entry into vocational education but do not prepare for employment in a particular occupation, trade or class of occupations or trades, nor lead directly to a labour market-relevant qualification.\n\n\n\nA specific stage of instruction in initial education usually covered during an academic year. Students in the same grade are usually of similar age. This is also referred to as a ‘class’, ‘cohort’ or ‘year’. School attendance is regular attendance at any regular accredited educational institution or programme, public or private, for organized learning at any level of education.\n\n\n\nThese are those who entered and successfully completed an education programme which is classified as ‘level completion’.\n\n\n\nTotal enrollment in a specific level of education, regardless of age, is expressed as a percentage of the eligible official school-age population corresponding to the same level of education in a given school year.\n\n\n\nTotal number of new entrants into the last grade of primary or secondary education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the population at the intended entrance age to the last grade of primary education or secondary education.\n\n\n\nThe highest grade or level of education which the population 4 years and above have reached or attained.\n\n\n\nOccur as a by-product of day-to-day activities, events or communication that are not designed as deliberate educational or learning activities. Examples may include learning that takes place during the course of a meeting, whilst listening to a radio programme, or watching a television broadcast that is not designed as an education programme.\n\n\n\nForms of learning that are intentional or deliberate but are not institutionalised. It is consequently less organized and structured than either formal or non-formal education. Informal learning may include learning activities that occur in the family, workplace, local community and daily life, on a self-directed, family-directed or socially directed basis.\n\n\n\nIs an educational setting that provides education in non-traditional settings. This school often offers flexible schedules, personalized learning approaches, and may focus on specific interests or skills. An informal school may not adhere to strict curriculum guidelines or educational standards established by government authorities, but they provide valuable educational opportunities tailored to the needs of individual learners. Examples of Informal schools are community-based learning centers, homeschooling arrangements, or alternative education programs that provide education in non-traditional settings.\n\n\n\nThese are schools that have inclusive educational settings where Learners with special needs are included in regular classrooms alongside their typically developing peers. These schools support and accommodate learners with special needs and disabilities to enable them to participate fully in schooling. The schools promote social integration and provide a supportive environment for all learners.\n\n\n\nSchools that offer educational programs based on curricula from other countries (e.g., British-IGCSE, American, International Baccalaureate, etc).\n\n\n\nSystem of education in which learners are imparted with the ability to apply appropriate knowledge and skills to successfully perform a function. The curriculum is designed to emphasize the importance of not only developing skills and knowledge but also applying these to real life situations. The integration of pertinent and contemporary issues and service learning into the framework will provide the opportunity for learners to develop and apply their skills and knowledge, or in other words, their competencies.\n\n\n\nAn individual acquisition or modification of information, knowledge, understanding, attitudes, values, skills, competencies or behaviours through experience, practice, study or instruction.\n\n\n\nDeliberate activity in which an individual participates with the intention to learn.\n\n\n\nSpecification of learning outcomes to be achieved upon completion of an educational or learning activity. These encompass improving knowledge, skills and competencies within any personal, civic, social or employment-related context. Learning objectives are typically linked to the purpose of preparing for more advanced studies and/or an occupation, trade, or class of occupations or trades.\n\n\n\nThe totality of information, knowledge, understanding, attitudes, values, skills, competencies or behaviours an individual is expected to master upon successful completion of an education programme.\n\n\n\nIs a person of either sex, not classified as usually economically active, who attends any regular educational institution, public or private, for systematic instruction at any level of education.\n\n\n\nThe ability to write meaningfully and read with understanding in any language. A person who cannot write meaningfully and read with understanding in any language is considered illiterate. A literate person is one who can both read and write, with understanding, a short, simple statement on his or her everyday life. An illiterate person is one who cannot, with understanding, both read and write such a statement.\n\n\n\nThe proportion of the population above 10 years who can write and read with understanding, expressed as a percentage of the total population above that age.\n\n\n\nIs a pre-school that provides learning to children on koranic education and basic literacy.\n\n\n\nAre often designed to provide participants with advanced academic and/or professional knowledge, skills and competencies, leading to a second degree or equivalent qualification. Programmes at this level may have a substantial research component but do not yet lead to the award of a doctoral qualification. Typically, programmes at this level are theoretically-based but may include practical components and are informed by state of the art research and/or best professional practice. They are traditionally offered by universities and other tertiary educational institutions.\n\n\n\nWhich is part of TVET education offers business and professional studies programmes leading to the award of certificates and diplomas in various disciplines. These learning institutions are open to students who have completed secondary education.\n\n\n\nEnrolment of the official age group for a given level of education expressed as a percentage of the corresponding population.\n\n\n\nQualification awarded upon achievement of the learning objectives of an education programme in non-formal education that is not recognised by the relevant national education authorities as being equivalent to a formal qualification.\n\n\n\nThe ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide. More broadly, it means the knowledge and skills required to effectively manage and respond to mathematical demands posed by diverse situations, involving objects, pictures, numbers, symbols, formulas, diagrams, maps, graphs, tables and text.\n\n\n\nA planned in a pattern or sequence with explicit or implicit aims. It involves a providing agency (person(s) or body) that facilitates a learning environment, and a method of instruction through which communication is organized. Instruction typically involves a teacher or trainer who is engaged in communicating and guiding knowledge and skills with a view to bringing about learning. The medium of instruction can also be indirect, e.g. through radio, television, computer software, film, recordings, Internet or other communication technologies.\n\n\n\nChildren and young people in the official age range for a given level of education who are not enrolled in primary, secondary or higher levels of education.\n\n\n\nThis is an indicator that measures the exposure of children to organized learning activities one year before they start primary school.\n\n\n\nProvides learning experiences building on secondary education, preparing for labour market entry as well as tertiary education. It aims at the individual acquisition of knowledge, skills and competencies lower than the level of complexity characteristic of tertiary education.\n\n\n\nProvides learning for children of age 6-11 years. Primary education is typically designed to provide students with fundamental skills in reading, writing and mathematics (i.e. literacy and numeracy) and establish a solid foundation for learning and understanding core areas of knowledge, personal and social development, in preparation for lower secondary education. It focuses on learning at a basic level of complexity with little, if any, specialisation.\n\n\n\nAverage number of primary school pupils per primary school classrooms.\n\n\n\nThe number of pupils in the school divided by the total number of latrine stances in the school.\n\n\n\nTotal number of pupils enrolled in a given school divided by the total number of teachers in the same school.\n\n\n\nThe number of pupils using a single textbook.\n\n\n\nThis refers to regular or mainstream schools that primarily serve typically developing Learners without significant learning disabilities or special needs. These schools follow the standard curriculum and may provide additional support to Learners who need some assistance, but they do not have specialized programs for Learners with special needs.\n\n\n\nThese are regular schools that have special education units or resource rooms within the school premises to cater for learners with special needs and disabilities. The said units provide targeted support and services to learners with special needs and disabilities while still allowing them to participate in some general education classes with their peers without special needs and disabilities.\n\n\n\nIt is a measure of the movement of learners from one grade or level of education to another and is usually a crude measure of prospects or opportunities for mobility that exist within the education system.\n\n\n\nIt is a measure of persons enrolled in a certain education level when they are already over-age in comparison to the official age category.\n\n\n\nThe number of children in the population who have attained the official school attendance age based on the national curriculum, whether enrolled in school or not.\n\n\n\nProvides learning for children of age 14-17 and on completion, students sit and receive a Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) qualification. lower secondary education, are typically designed to build on the learning outcomes from primary. Usually, the aim is to lay the foundation for lifelong learning and human development upon which education systems may then expand further educational opportunities. Upper secondary education is typically designed to complete secondary education in preparation for tertiary education or provide skills relevant to employment, or both.\n\n\n\nEducation is designed to facilitate learning by individuals who, for a wide variety of reasons, require additional support and adaptive pedagogical methods in order to participate and meet learning objectives in an education programme. Reasons may include (but are not limited to) disadvantages in physical, behavioural, intellectual, emotional and social capacities. Education programmes in special needs education may follow a similar curriculum as that offered in the parallel regular education system, but they take individual needs into account by providing specific resources (e.g. specially-trained personnel, equipment or space) and, if appropriate, modified educational content or learning objectives. These programmes can be offered to individual students within already-existing education programmes or as a separate class in the same or separate educational institutions.\n\n\n\nThese are schools specifically designed to exclusively cater for learners with special needs or significant learning disabilities. These schools have specialized programs, teaching methods, and support services to address the individual needs of their learners. The curriculum provided in these schools may be adapted to suit the abilities and learning styles of their learners.\n\n\n\nA group of pupils who enter the first grade of a level of education in the same school year and subsequently experience promotion, repetition, drop-out or successful completion, each in his or her own way.\n\n\n\nThe learning experience has the elements of duration and continuity.\n\n\n\nPersons who, in their professional capacity, guide and direct learners in gaining knowledge, attitudes and skills that are stipulated by a defined curriculum programme.\n\n\n\nEducation that offers various technical and vocational courses which include trade test courses in vocational training centres (formerly youth polytechnics), artisan, craft and diploma courses in technical and vocational colleges (formerly technical training institutes and institutes of technology); craft and diploma courses in national polytechnics, the leads to trade tests, certificates and diplomas in various disciplines. This level of education is designed for learners who have completed primary or secondary education and also youth who, for some reason, do not enrol in the regular education system at the primary education level.\n\n\n\nTertiary education builds on secondary education, providing learning activities in specialised fields of education. It aims at learning at a high level of complexity and specialisation.\n\n\n\nTotal number of students of the official age group for a given level of education who are enrolled in any level of education, expressed as a percentage of the corresponding population.\n\n\n\nEducation designed to achieve particular learning objectives, especially in vocational education.\n\n\n\nIs open to students who have completed secondary education, lasts a minimum of 4 years, and leads to a bachelor’s degree. This level of education also includes post-graduate programmes leading to post-graduate diplomas, masters and doctorate degrees.\n\n\n\nEducation programmes that are designed for learners to acquire the knowledge, skills and competencies specific to a particular occupation, trade, or class of occupations or trades. Vocational education may have work-based components (e.g. apprenticeships, dual-system education programmes). Successful completion of such programmes leads to labour market-relevant vocational qualifications acknowledged as occupationally-oriented by the relevant national authorities and/or the labour market.\n\n\n\nEducational activities which take place in a work environment, usually in the context of vocational education programmes. The aim is to achieve specific learning objectives through practical instruction and participation in work activities under the guidance of experienced workers or trainers.\n\n\n\nRefers to population age 15-34 for training and age 15-24 as used in enrolment for international comparison.\n\n\n\nTransition rate refers to the number of students admitted to the first grade of a higher level of education in a given year, expressed as a percentage of the number of students enrolled in the final grade of the lower level of education in the previous year."

    "text": "Households have personal needs and wants that are directly satisfied through consumption of goods and services resulting from activities that are productive in an economic sense. These goods and services are referred to as consumer goods and services and their individual value is defined as the consumption expenditure on these goods or services. \n\n\nHousehold income is the sum of money income and income in kind and consists of receipts which, as a rule, are of a recurring nature and accrue to the household or to individual members of the household regularly at annual or at more frequent intervals (ILO,2000). Household income consists of receipts in cash, in kind or in services, that are usually recurrent and regular and are received by the household or by individual members of the household at annual or at more frequent intervals. During the reference period when they are received, such receipts are potentially available for current consumption and, as a rule, do not reduce the net worth of the household (ILO,2001). Income is thus defined in terms of a broad grouping of sources of income as follows:\n\n\n\nIncome from employment comprises receipts from involvement in economic activities, strictly in an employment-related capacity. It consists of employee income (e.g. wages) and self-employment income (return to labour), (ILO, 2000).\n\n\n\nEmployee income consists of direct wages and salaries, cash bonuses and gratuities, commissions, directors’ fees, profit-sharing bonuses and other forms of profit-related pay, remuneration for time not worked (e.g. as sick leave or annual leave), free or subsidized goods and services from an employer as well as severance and termination pay. Employee income can be in cash (in the sense of monetary), in kind as goods or services.\n\n\n\nIncome from self-employment is defined as the income which is received, over a given reference period, by individuals, for themselves or in respect of their family members, as a result of their current or former involvement in self-employment jobs” (ILO 2000). Income from self employment is taken as income received as a result of involvement in a self-employment job. It should be noted that this component is restricted to owners of unincorporated enterprises who work in such enterprises.\n\n\n\nProperty incomeis income received from ownership of financial and other assets, e.g. interest payments. Property income consists of receipts received as a result of ownership of financial and non-financial assets that are provided to others for their use. These are usually in the form of interest receipts, dividends, rents received for the use of unproduced assets (natural resources), royalties for use of intellectual property and rents received for produced assets.\n\n\n\nThis is income from household production of services for own consumption, e.g. services of owner-occupied housing, household production of domestic services for own consumption. These are services produced within the household for the household’s own consumption and not for the market. They include services from owner-occupied dwellings and from consumer durable goods owned as well as own-produced domestic services. They are valued net of expenses that go into their production\n\n\n\nTransfers are receipts for which there is no “quid pro quo”, i.e. nothing tangible is given by the recipient to the donor in return for the receipts. Transfers may be made between households, between households and government or between households and charities. Transfers are mainly  motivated by the intention to redistribute income. Transfers can consist of cash (monetary) or goods or of services and can cross national boundaries. Capital transfers are one-off or irregular and are usually large, lump-sum receipts. In contrast, current transfers usually recur regularly and tend to be small. Current transfers are also mostly available for use in consumption expenditure during the reference period while recipients of capital transfers do not usually regard them as income and do not use them wholly for consumption expenditure during the reference period.\n\n\n\nCurrent transfers whether in cash or goods consist of social security pensions/schemes; pensions and other insurance benefits; current transfers from non-profit institutions and current transfers from other households.\n\n\n\nThese aresocial transfers in kind from government-provided services to individual households such as education, health, social welfare, transport and cultural services.\n\n\n\nHolding gains are changes in the value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities over a reference period which occur without any direct action of the owner, for example, changes in the value of stocks and shares. A holding gain, the result of an increase in assets or a reduction in liability, increases the net worth of the owner’s assets while a loss has the opposite effect.\n\n\n\nThis is the value of consumer goods and services that were acquired (used or paid for) by a household for the direct satisfaction of the needs and wants of its members through direct monetary purchases in the market; through the market-place but without using any money as means of payment (barter, income in kind); or from production within the household (own-account production).\n\n\n\nThis is expenditure incurred on goods including food items, personal care items, fuel, educational and entertainment items,  household items such as cleaning products and so on.\n\n\n\nThis is expenditure on household kitchen appliances, household information and entertainment appliances, other household appliances, household transportation equipment, other household items, clothing items, utensils, and so on. Consumer goods that are used many times over a long period of time without reducing their capacity to satisfy needs and wants are referred to as durable goods.\n\n\n\nIntertemporal consumption refers to how individuals allocate their consumption of goods and services across different time periods, typically balancing consumption today versus in the future. The decision is influenced by factors such as income, interest rates, time preferences, and expectations about the future.\nNet Disposable Income"

    "text": "Social protection is the systematic intervention intended to relieve households and individuals of the burden of a defined set of social risks. Social protection can be organized as social assistance or social insurance schemes, with the latter organized as social security schemes or employment-related social insurance schemes.” Kenya’s social protection sector is structured into three pillars: social assistance, social security and social health insurance.\n\n\nThese are direct, regular and predictable transfers that raise and smooth incomes to reduce poverty and vulnerability. Unconditional Cash Transfers (UCTs) are for the beneficiary to decide how to spend. Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs) are given with the requirement that the beneficiary meets certain conditions – often related to human capital development, such as visiting a health clinic or ensuring children go to school.\n\n\n\nThis Fund was established under Section 28 of the SHIA (2023), and it covers costs related to managing chronic illnesses after the depletion of social health insurance cover and funds emergency treatment. In contrast, NHIF provides general health insurance coverage for various medical needs. The Emergency, Chronic, and Critical Illness Fund has diverse funding sources, including appropriations by the National Assembly, gifts, grants, donations, endowments, or funds from any other lawful source.\n\n\n\nInua Jamii is a cash transfer programme implemented by the Kenyan government to cushion vulnerable members of society and improve their livelihood. The objective of the program is to uplift the lives of poor and vulnerable Kenyans through regular and reliable cash transfers. It represents the first building block towards a universal social protection system in Kenya. The programme is completely funded by the Government and aims to reach all people aged 70 or older who are not already in receipt of a civil service pension, providing them with a monthly cash transfer disbursed every two months.\n\n\n\nThis is a programme that provides a common operating framework to harmonise the delivery of Kenya’s tax-financed social protection schemes.\n\n\n\nThis is a mandatory national scheme whose main objective is to provide basic financial security benefits to Kenyans upon retirement. The Fund was set up as a Provident Fund providing benefits in the form of a lump sum.\n\n\n\nThis is a fund that focuses on procuring primary healthcare services from health facilities. It is funded through various sources, including appropriations by the National Assembly, grants, gifts, donations, bequests, fees, levies, and funds from other relevant sources. SHI aims to remove limitations on specific medical expenses, such as pre-treatment blood works and certain CT scans, and includes coverage for congenital conditions and preventive measures not previously covered.\n\n\n\nThese are programmes that provide jobs on infrastructure projects for cash or food. They are sometimes classified as labour market interventions depending on whether their function is primarily poverty alleviation, job creation, or social protection. In Kenya, such programmes include ‘Kazi Kwa Vijana’.\n\n\n\nThis is a regulatory body established by the Government of Kenya to supervise the establishment and management of retirement benefits schemes in the Republic of Kenya.\n\n\n\nThis is a free nutritious meal at school – usually lunch – and sometimes take-home rations for children most in need. This is a type of in-kind assistance. They help encourage parents to keep children in school.\n\n\n\nThis is direct, regular and predictable cash or in-kind resources transfers to poor and vulnerable individuals or households. It is usually provided by the state and financed by national taxes. Transfers are non-contributory, i.e. the full amount is paid by the provider. Some are targeted based on categories of vulnerability, and some are targeted broadly to low-income groups.\n\n\n\nThis is a State corporation under the Government of Kenya responsible for the provision and management of public health insurance within the Republic of Kenya. The core mandate of the SHA is to provide accessible, affordable, sustainable, and quality health insurance for all Kenyan citizens and, where applicable, foreign residents.\n\n\n\nThis is a social health insurance system in Kenya that is operated through individuals contributing funds to a common pool through regular premiums, deducted from salaries or paid directly, to finance care services for themselves and their dependents. The Social Health Insurance Fund is governed by the Social Health Insurance Act (SHIA) of 2023 and it introduces three funds: Social Health Insurance Fund (SHIF), Primary Healthcare Fund and Emergency, Chronic, and Critical Illness Fund.\n\n\n\nThis is a fund aimed at promoting the implementation of universal health coverage by ensuring all individuals and communities receive the health services they need, including the full spectrum of essential, quality health services from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care without suffering financial hardship. The fund has been established by the government to improve the quality of life for all citizens by providing equitable, accessible, affordable, and high-standard healthcare.\n\n\n\nThese are contributory programmes where participants make regular payments to a scheme that will cover costs related to life-course events, for example, maternity, unemployment or illness. Social insurance includes contributory pensions; health, unemployment, or disaster insurance; and funeral assistance. Social insurance is strongly linked to the formal labour market, meaning coverage is often limited to formal workers.\n\n\n\nThese are state pensions, a form of cash transfer targeted by age. Pensions are the most common social protection tool, with the widest global coverage and often highest national spend. The current pensions schemes in Kenya comprise the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) which is a state contributory scheme mandatory for all employers and employees in the formal sector and informal sector workers who can contribute on voluntary basis, Civil Servants Pension Scheme which is non-contributory and administered by The National Treasury for the government for retired civil servants and (iii) private pension schemes.\n\n\n\nDefined as events or circumstances that may adversely affect the welfare of households either by imposing additional demands on their resources or by reducing their income. Needs may occur due to sickness, unemployment, retirement, housing, education, or family circumstances.\n\n\n\nSocial security is defined as the security that the society furnishes through appropriate organizations against certain risks to which its members are exposed. The concept of social security is based on ideas of human dignity and social justice. The underlying idea behind social security measures is that a citizen who has contributed or is likely to con­tribute to his/her country’s welfare should be given protection against certain hazards. The concept of social security, thus, is based on the ideals of human dignity and socio-economic justice. Underlying the concept is also the desire to give protection to its citizens to contribute to a coun­try’s total welfare against certain hazards of life to which they are exposed either in the working life or as a consequence of it.\n\n\n\nThis is a poverty-targeted and household-based programme with the objective of providing regular cash transfers to poor families living with children identified as OVCs to encourage fostering and retention of children and promote their human capital development. OVCs are defined in the programme as children aged 0-17 years old with at least one deceased parent, or a parent who is chronically ill, or whose main caregiver is chronically ill.\n\n\n\nThis is a poverty-targeted and household-based programme that seeks to enhance the capacities of care givers through cash transfers and as such, improve the livelihoods of persons with severe disabilities as well as reduce negative impact of disability on households. It targets adults and children with severe disabilities, who require full time support of a caregiver. The objectives of the programme are to: to strengthen the capacities of parents and children with disabilities; improve the livelihoods of parents and children with disabilities and to alleviate integrated poverty among parents and children with disabilities.\n\n\n\nThis is a poverty-targeted and household-based programme where cash is transferred unconditionally to households in ASALs with the aim of reducing poverty, food insecurity and malnutrition, and promote asset retention and accumulation in poor households."

    "text": "Culture is a set of distinctive spiritual, material, intellectual and emotional features of society or a social group that encompasses not only art and literature, but lifestyles, ways of living together, value systems, traditions and beliefs (UNESCO, 2001). Whereas it is not always possible to measure such beliefs and values directly, it is possible to measure associated behaviours and practices.\nCulture plays a key role in all societies around the world, influencing various facets of peoples’ lives, from leisure to professional activities.\n\n\n\nAre measures undertaken to extend the life of cultural heritage while strengthening transmission of its significant heritage messages and values (ICCROM, 1998). In the domain of cultural property, the aim of conservation is to maintain the physical and cultural characteristics of the object to ensure that its value is not diminished and that it will outlive our limited time span (UNESCO, 1988).\n\n\n\nThis is one of the main branches of intellectual property. It applies to “every production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression. The expression “literary and artistic works” is to be understood, for the purposes of copyright protection, as including every original work of authorship, irrespective of its literary or artistic merit. Literary and artistic works include books, pamphlets and other writings, music, plays, choreography, photography, films, paintings, drawings, architecture, engraving, lithography (WIPO, 2003, 1979).\n\n\n\nThese are defined as “those produced by artisans, either completely by hand or with the help of hand-tools or even mechanical means, as long as the direct manual contribution of the artisan remains the most substantial component of the finished product. The special nature of artisanal products derives from their distinctive features, which can be utilitarian, aesthetic, artistic, creative, culturally attached, decorative, functional, traditional, religiously and socially symbolic and significant” (UNESCO and ITC, 1997).\n\n\n\nThey embody or convey cultural expressions, irrespective of the commercial value they may have. Cultural activities may be an end in themselves or they may contribute to the production of cultural goods and services.\n\n\n\nRefers to the many ways in which the different cultures of groups and societies find expression. These cultural expressions are passed on within and among groups and societies, and from generation to generation. Cultural diversity, however, is evident not only in the varied ways in which cultural heritage is expressed, augmented and transmitted but also in the different modes of artistic creation, production, dissemination, distribution and enjoyment, whatever the means and technologies that are used.\n\n\n\nDefined as consumer goods that convey ideas, symbols and ways of life, i.e. books, magazines, multimedia products software, recordings, films, videos, audio-visual programmes, crafts and fashion.\n\n\n\nThis includes artefacts, monuments, a group of buildings and sites that have a diversity of values including symbolic, historic, artistic, aesthetic, ethnological or anthropological, scientific and social significance (UNESCO, 1972). Cultural industries produce and distribute cultural goods or services as defined above.\n\n\n\nRepresents combined works of nature and humans, and they express a long and intimate relationship between people and their natural environment (UNESCO, 2007).\n\n\n\nThis is participation in the arts and everyday life activities that may be associated with a particular culture. It refers to “the ways in which ethnically-marked differences in cultural tastes, values and behaviours inform not just artistic and media preferences but are embedded in the daily rhythms of different ways of life; and of the ways in which these connect with other relevant social characteristics – those of class and gender, for example” (Bennett, 2001).\n\n\n\nThis is participation in the arts and everyday life activities that may be associated with a particular culture. It refers to “the ways in which ethnically-marked differences in cultural tastes, values and behaviours inform not just artistic and media preferences but are embedded in the daily rhythms of different ways of life; and of the ways in which these connect with other relevant social characteristics – those of class and gender, for example” (Bennett, 2001).\n\n\n\nConsists of units mainly engaged in the creative, artistic and aesthetic design of objects, environments and services (ABS, 2001).\n\n\n\nThe process of conceptualizing and creating clothing, footwear, and fashion accessories that reflect aesthetic, cultural, or functional values. It is recognized as part of the creative industries and may involve both artisanal and industrial methods. Fashion design is protected under intellectual property frameworks such as industrial design and copyright\n\n\n\nCarried out by companies or individuals engaged primarily in the design of graphic material for the purposes of display or publication.\n\n\n\nPeoples are persons in independent countries who are regarded as “indigenous” on account of their descent from the populations which inhabited the country, or a geographical region to which the country belongs, at the time of conquest or colonisation or the establishment of present state boundaries and who, irrespective of their legal status, retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions” (ILO, 1989).\n\n\n\nDefined as “the practices, representations, expressions, knowledge, skills – as well as the instruments, objects, artefacts and cultural spaces associated therewith – that communities, groups and, in some cases, individuals recognise as part of their cultural heritage. This intangible cultural heritage, transmitted from generation to generation, is constantly recreated by communities and groups in response to their environment, their interaction with nature and their history, and provides them with a sense of identity and continuity, thus promoting respect for cultural diversity and human creativity” (UNESCO, 2003).\n\n\n\nDefined as media where either i) two or more objects have an effect on one another; ii) the user can effect a change on an object or within the environment (users playing videos games); iii) they involve active participation of a user; or iv) there is two way effect as opposed to one way or simple cause effect (Canadian Heritage, 2008).\n\n\n\nActivities carried out by companies and individuals engaged primarily in the design of interior environments of buildings, private and public, residential and commercial (Statistics New Zealand, 1995).\n\n\n\nCovers the design of lands and gardens for human use. Usually, this relates to the design of and adjacent to buildings, either private or public, but the design can also relate to large public areas such as parks and reserves (Statistics New Zealand, 1995).\n\n\n\nThis is an organisation, or part of an organisation, whose main aims are to build and maintain a collection and to facilitate the use of such information resources and facilities as are required to meet the informational, research, educational, cultural or recreational needs of its users; these are the basic requirements for a library and do not exclude any additional resources and services incidental to its main purpose (ISO, 2006). It includes any organized collection of books and periodicals in electronic or in printed form or of any other graphic or audio-visual materials (adapted from UNESCO, 1970). It includes virtual libraries, digital catalogues.\n\n\n\nA non-profit, permanent institution in the service of society and its development, open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits the tangible and intangible heritage of humanity and its environment for the purposes of education, study and enjoyment.\na. The above definition of a museum shall be applied without any limitation arising from the nature of the governing body, the territorial character, the functional structure or the orientation of the collections of the institution concerned.\nb. In addition to institutions designated as ‘museums’ the following qualify as museums for the purposes of this definition:\ni. natural, archaeological and ethnographic monuments and sites and historical monuments and sites of a museum nature that acquire, conserve and communicate material evidence of people and their environment;\nii. institutions holding collections of and displaying live specimens of plants and animals, such as  botanical and zoological gardens, aquaria and vivaria;\niii. science centres and planetaria;\niv. non-profit art exhibition galleries\nv. nature reserves; conservation institutes and exhibition galleries permanently maintained by libraries and archives centres; natural parks;\nvi. international or national or regional or local museum organisations, ministries or departments or public agencies responsible for museums as per the definition given under this article;\nvii. non-profit institutions or organisations undertaking conservation research, education, training, documentation and other activities relating to museums and museology;\nviii. cultural centres and other entities that facilitate the preservation, continuation\nand management of tangible or intangible heritage resources (living heritage and digital creative activity); and\nix. such other institutions as the Executive Council, after seeking the advice of the Advisory Committee, considers as having some or all the characteristics of a museum, or as supporting museums and professional museum personnel through museological research, education or training (ICOM 2007).\n\n\n\nThis consists of natural features, geological and physiographical formations and delineated areas that constitute the habitat of threatened species of animals and plants and natural sites of value from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty. It includes nature parks and reserves, zoos, aquaria and botanical gardens (UNESCO, 1972).\n\n\n\nRefers to professional or amateur performing arts activities, such as theatre, dance, opera and puppetry, as well as the celebration of cultural events (festivals, feasts and fairs), which occur locally and can be informal in nature.\n\n\n\nThe aim of preservation is to prevent damage liable to be caused by environmental or accidental factors, which pose a threat in the immediate surroundings of the object to be conserved. Accordingly, preventive methods and measures are not usually applied directly but are designed to control the microclimatic conditions of the environment with the aim of eradicating harmful agents or elements, which may have a temporary or permanent influence on the deterioration of the object (UNESCO, 1988).\n\n\n\nDefined as an activity undertaken for pleasure or relaxation that diverts amuses or stimulates.\n\n\n\nConsists of companies and individuals mainly engaged in the presentation or provision of sports and physical recreation and associated services. Coaching and education services related to sports and physical recreation are included. Also included are business units, which manufacture wholesale or retail sports and physical recreation goods.\n\n\n\nRefers to the knowledge, innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities around the world. Developed from experience gained over the centuries and adapted to the local culture and environment, traditional knowledge is transmitted orally from generation to generation. It tends to be collectively owned and takes the form of stories, songs, folklore, proverbs, cultural values, beliefs, rituals, community laws, local language and agricultural practices, including the development of plant species and animal breeds. Traditional knowledge is mainly of a practical nature, particularly in such fields as agriculture, fisheries, health, horticulture, forestry and environmental management in general” (SCBD, 2007).\n\n\n\nPersons in independent countries whose social, cultural and economic conditions distinguish them from other sections of the national community, and whose status is regulated wholly or partially by their own customs or traditions or by special laws or regulations.\n\n\n\nAppeal primarily to the visual sense; they are art forms that focus on the creation of works, which are primarily visual in nature, or are multidimensional objects."

Therefore, the participation rate for the activity is required, and two series of tables are presented:\n1.       Average time spent per day by the population and\n2.     Average time spent per day by persons who engaged in the activity.\nBasic time use statistics typically provide estimates of the average time spent per day on various types of activities by individuals within specific demographic groups. These categories may include men, women, boys, and girls within certain age groups, as well as distinctions such as rural or urban residence, employment status, and more. To ensure accurate averages, time use data should encompass both weekdays and weekends, and account for seasonal variations throughout the year.\n\n\n\nThe participation rate refers to the proportion of individuals in the survey population who took part in a specific activity during the reference period, such as in  the last 24 hours.\n\n\n\nA one-hour interval within a 24-hour period during which respondents reported one or more activities.\n\n\n\nSimultaneous activities are those undertaken by the same person at the same time and place.

All such activities fall within the general production boundary.\n\n\n\nReproductive work includes activities such as rearing and caring for children; caring for the elderly, ill, disabled and other household members; caring unpaid for non-family members; and cooking, cleaning and fetching water and fuel. Though these activities are productive, they are not included in GDP calculations.\n\n\n\nThis refers to time spent caring for or helping any child (under 18) or adult in the household, regardless of their health status. Care is categorized into:\n\n\n\nTime spent directly and exclusively on a child while not engaged in any other activity, such as feeding, bathing, playing, or helping with homework.\n\n\n\nTime spent directly helping or caring for an adult, such as bathing, grooming, or assisting with household tasks like cleaning or cooking.\n\n\n\nCare provided while engaged in another primary activity. For example, watching over a child doing homework while cooking dinner or watching over a sick parent while doing house chores\n\n\n\nStatistical survey that aims to report data on how people spend their time.

Expenditure on mineral exploration and military ware not used purely for war purposes are included in GFCF. However, intangible assets, such as copyrights, computer software etc, are not included due to unavailability of reliable data.\n\n\n2.1.1.22 Fixed Assets\nTangible or intangible assets produced as outputs from processes of production that are themselves used repeatedly or continuously in other processes of production for more than one year.\n\n\n2.1.1.23 Consumption of Fixed Capital\nConstitutes the decline in the value of the fixed assets owned by an enterprise, as a result of their physical deterioration and normal rates of obsolescence and accidental damage.

GNI is the gross domestic product, plus net receipts from abroad of compensation of employees, property income and net taxes less subsidies on production.\n\n\n2.1.1.29 Gross National Disposable Income\nGross national disposable income may be derived from gross national income by adding all current transfers in cash or in kind receivable by resident institutional units from non-resident units and subtracting all current transfers in cash or in kind payable by resident institutional units to non-resident units.\n\n\n2.1.1.30 Saving\nNet saving is net disposable income less final consumption expenditure.\n\n\n2.1.1.31 Net Lending/Borrowing\nNet amount a unit or a sector has available to finance, directly or indirectly, other units or other sectors; it is the balancing item in the capital account and is defined as: (Net saving plus capital transfers receivable minus capital transfers payable) minus (the value of acquisitions less disposals of non-financial assets, less consumption of fixed capital); negative net lending may also be described as “net borrowing”.\n\n\n2.1.1.32 GDP Statistical Discrepancy\nThis is the difference between GDP compiled by the various approaches, e.g. the difference between GDP by production approach and GDP by expenditure approach.\n\n\n2.1.1.33 Supply and use Tables\nThe Supply Table describes how goods and services become available in an economy during a certain period of time. Products are either produced in the domestic industry or imported.  The Use Table shows how goods and services are used in the economy during a certain period of time.\n\n\n2.1.1.34 Input-Output Tables\nAn input-output table is a means of presenting a detailed analysis of the process of production and the use of goods and services (products) and the income generated in that production.; they can be either in the form of (a) supply and use tables or (b) symmetric input-output tables.\n\n\n2.1.1.35 Social Accounting Matrices (SAM)\nA means of presenting the SNA accounts in a matrix which elaborates the linkages between a supply and use table and institutional sector accounts; a typical focus of a SAM on the role of people in the economy may be reflected by, among other things, extra breakdowns of the household sector and a disaggregated representation of labour markets (i.e., distinguishing various categories of employed persons).\n\n\n2.1.1.36 Satellite Accounts\nSatellite accounts provide a framework linked to the central accounts and which enables attention to be focussed on a certain field or aspect of economic and social life in the context of national accounts; common examples are satellite accounts for the environment, or tourism, or unpaid household work.\n\n\n\n2.1.2 Balance of payments and international investment position\n\n2.1.2.1 Balance of Payments\nA systematic statistical statement that summarizes for a given period (e.g. calendar year), an economy’s transactions with the rest of the world. BOP captures transactions between residents and nonresidents, irrespective of the currency in which the transaction is made. BOP comprises the Current Account (Goods and Services; Primary Income; and Secondary Income) and the Capital and Financial Accounts.\n\n\n2.1.2.2 Current Account\nThe current account focuses on transactions related to the exchange of goods, services, income, and current transfers. It consists of Goods, Services, Primary Income and Secondary Income sub-accounts.\n\n\n2.1.2.3 Goods Account\nIncludes the export and import of physical goods (merchandise). It also includes trade in goods by a resident and subsequent resale of these goods without them being physically present in the country. This concept is referred to as merchanting.\n\n\n2.1.2.4 Services Account\nIt covers the export and import of services. These are categorized into twelve broad categories in the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition (BPM6) as follows; Manufacturing of Physical Inputs owned by Others; Maintenance and Repair Services; Transport; Travel; Construction; Insurance and Pension Services; Financial Services; Charges for the use of  intellectual property n.i.e; Telecommunications, Computer and Information Services; Other Business Services (including Trade, Technical and related services,Research and development services, professional and management consulting services, waste treatment and depollution, agricultural and mining services, operating leasing, Trade related services ; Personal, cultural and recreation services; and Government  goods and services n.i.e\n\n\n2.1.2.5 Primary Income Account\nPrimary income captures returns for the provision of labor and financial assets; and renting of natural resources between resident and non-resident entities. This account records compensation of employees, income from investments such as dividends, interest, reinvested earnings; investment income attributable to policyholders in insurance, standardized guarantees, and pension funds; and rent.\n\n\n2.1.2.6 Secondary Income Account\nThis account records transfers of money or value between residents and non-residents, where no goods or services are exchanged. This includes:\n·       Personal transfers: All current transfers in cash or in kind made or received by resident households to or from nonresident households. They include remittances sent by workers to their families in their home countries.\n·       Other current transfers: These include Social contributions, social benefits,net premiums and claims on non-life insurance, Contributions from foreign governments, charitable donations, and other financial transfers, including aid and gifts.\n\n\n2.1.2.7 Current Account Balance\nThe current account balance is the sum of the balances of the four sub-accounts:\nCurrent Account Balance (CAB) = Balance of the Goods Account + Services Account Balance + Balance in the Primary Income Account + Balance in the Secondary Income Account\n\n\n2.1.2.8 Current Account Surplus/Deficit\nA current account surplus occurs when a country earns more income from abroad than it spends i.e. the CAB is a positive value. On the other hand, a current account deficit results from greater expenditure on goods produced or services rendered by non-residents as well as increased payments on factors of production, including interest and labour.\n\n\n2.1.2.9 Capital Account\nThis account shows (a) capital transfers receivable and payable between residents and nonresidents and (b) the acquisition and disposal of non-produced, nonfinancial assets between residents and nonresidents.\nCapital transfers are transfers in which the ownership of an asset (other than cash or inventories) changes from one party to another; or which obliges one or both parties to acquire or dispose of an asset (other than cash or inventories); or where a liability is forgiven by the creditor. This include debt forgiveness, investment grants, one-off guarantees and debt assumption, large gifts and inheritances (legacies), including those to nonprofit  institutions; cash grants from donor governments or multilateral financial institutions to the debtor economy to be used to repay debt\nNon-produced, non-financial assets consist of natural resources, contracts, leases and licenses; and marketing assets (including goodwill).\n\n\n2.1.2.10 Financial Account\nThis account records transactions that involve financial assets and liabilities that take place between residents and nonresidents. It tracks cross-border investments and transactions that change the ownership of financial assets and liabilities. The financial account indicates the functional categories, sectors, instruments and maturities used for net international financing transactions. Entries in the financial account can be corresponding entries to goods, services, income, capital account, or other financial account entries. The financial account shows net acquisition of financial assets and net incurrence of liabilities. There are five functional categories in the Financial Account which include Direct Investment, Portfolio Investment, Other Investment, Financial Derivatives  and Reserve Assets.\n\n\n2.1.2.11 Direct Investment\nThis arises when an entity, resident in one economy has equity shareholding or equivalent voting rights of 10% per cent or more in an entity resident in another economy that gives rise to a significant degree of influence or control in the management of this non-resident entity. A significant degree of influence exists when the non-resident Direct Investor has shareholding or equivalent voting rights of between 10 to 50 per cent of the value resident entity while control exists when the shareholding is more than 50 per cent.\nEnterprises in a direct investment relationship with each other are called affiliates or affiliated enterprises. In addition, all enterprises that are under the control or influence of the same direct investor are considered to be in a direct investment relationship with each other.\n\n\n2.1.2.12 Portfolio Investment\nThis is defined as cross border transactions and positions involving debt or equity securities, other than those included in direct investment or reserve assets. Investments by a non-resident in an economy in form of shares/voting rights of less than 10% (equity securities) and/or investment in financial instruments which are tradable (debt/non-equity securities). The negotiability of securities is a way of facilitating trading, allowing them to be held by different parties during their lives.\nPortfolio investment covers, but is not limited to, securities traded on organized or other financial markets and usually involves financial infrastructure, such as a suitable legal, regulatory, and settlement framework, along with market-making dealers, and a sufficient volume of buyers and sellers. Transactions in listed equity in the Securities markets or organized exchanges constitute Portfolio Investment.\n\n\n2.1.2.13 Other Investment\nThis captures any other investment by a non-resident in an economy that cannot be classified either as Direct Investment, Portfolio Investment, financial derivatives and employee stock options; and reserve assets. This comprises other equity (less than 10% of voting rights and non-tradable); currency and deposits; loans (including the use of IMF credit and loans from the IMF); trade credits and advances; insurance, pension and standardized guarantee schemes; accounts payable and receivable; and SDR allocations.\nOther investments may be split by financial asset or liability class, original or remaining maturity, or institutional sector.\n\n\n2.1.2.14 Reserve Assets\nReserve assets are those external assets that are readily available to and controlled by monetary authorities for meeting balance of payments financing needs, for intervention in exchange markets to affect the currency exchange rate, and for other related purposes (such as maintaining confidence in the currency and the economy; and serving as a basis for foreign borrowing). This includes central bank holdings of foreign exchange reserves, monetary gold, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) holdings, Reserve Position in the Fund and debt securities .\n\n\n2.1.2.15 International Investment Position\nInternational Investment Position (IIP) is a statistical statement that shows at a point in time the value and composition of financial assets of residents of an economy that are claims on nonresidents and gold bullion held as reserve assets; and liabilities of residents of an economy to non residents. The key components of IIP are similar to the components of the Financial Account of the Balance of Payments and include Direct Investment Assets/Liabilities, Portfolio Investment Assets/Liabilities, Other Investment Assets/Liabilities, Financial derivatives and Reserve Assets.\nThe difference between an economy’s external financial assets and liabilities is the economy’s net IIP, which may be positive or negative.\n\n\n2.1.2.16 Financial Assets\nThese are financial claims by residents of a country on non-residents/rest of the world. The existence of the counterpart liability distinguishes financial assets from other economic assets, such as land, dwellings, machinery, equipment, etc.\n\n\n2.1.2.17 Financial Liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are financial claims on residents by non-residents/rest of the world.\n\n\n2.1.2.18 Rest of the world\nConsists of all non-resident institutional units that enter into transactions with resident units, or have other economic links with resident units.\n\n\n2.1.2.19 Residency\nA resident is an individual, entity or organization located in an economic territory, with which it has the centre of predominant economic interest. An enterprise incorporated in Kenya is considered a resident of Kenya irrespective of the location of the owners of the enterprise. A branch of a foreign enterprise operating (or intending to operate) in Kenya for more than a year is treated as a resident of Kenya. A household is resident in the economic territory in which household members maintain or intend to maintain a dwelling or succession of dwellings treated and used by members of the household as their principal dwelling. If an individual is present in a territory for one year or more or intending to do so is sufficient to qualify as having a principal dwelling there. If there is uncertainty about the principal dwelling, the length of time spent there should inform whether they are resident or not.\nA legal entity is resident in the economic territory under whose laws the entity is incorporated or registered. If there is no incorporation or registration, legal domicile is used to ascertain the residence of the entity.\nA Non Profit Institutions Serving Households (NPISH) has a center of economic interest in the economy in which the institution was legally created and is officially recognized and recorded as a legal or social entity. When an NPISH is engaged in charity or relief work on an international scale, it may maintain substantial operations for individual territories that may amount to branches.\nAn exception to this rule includes the following:\n1.       Diplomats of Foreign Governments, Embassies, Military bases of foreign governments, cross-border workers, Patients and Students who are residents of their economies.\n2.     International/multilateral organizations who are not residents of any Government e.g. World Bank Group, International Monetary Fund. International organizations are resident in an economic territory of their own, and not of the economy in which they are physically located. Some international organizations cover a group of economies in a particular region, such as with economic or currency unions. If statistics are prepared for that region as a whole, these regional organizations are residents of the region as a whole, even though they are not residents of any member economy.\n\n\n2.1.2.20 Transactions\nA transaction is an interaction between two institutional units that occurs by mutual agreement or through the operation of the law and involves an exchange of value or a transfer. Transactions are classified according to the nature of the economic value provided—namely, goods or services, primary income, secondary income, capital transfers, nonproduced non-financial assets, financial assets, or liabilities. Transactions recorded in the BOP. are interactions between a resident and a nonresident institutional unit.\n\n\n2.1.2.21 Positions\nStock of financial assets and liabilities at a specific point in time and are recorded in the IIP.\n\n\n2.1.2.22 Financial Instruments\nThese are financial contracts made between institutional units and can be broadly divided into:\n·       Equity and Investment Fund shares: These include shares and other forms of ownership in an enterprise.\n·       Non-Equity/Debt Instruments: These include currency and deposits, debt securities, loans, trade credits and advances; other accounts receivables/payables, insurance, pension and standardized guarantee schemes, financial derivatives and employee stock options are also included in other financial instruments.\n\n\n2.1.2.23 Reinvested Earnings\nIncome on equity not paid out to investors as dividends but retained in the enterprise (e.g., retained profits).\n\n\n2.1.2.24 Revaluations\nChanges in the value of assets due to price changes and reflect nominal hold- ing gains and losses on environmental assets. The nominal holding gain for environmental assets is calculated in the same way as for non-financial assets, as the increase in value accruing to the owner of the asset as a result of a change in its price over a period of time. Holding gains and losses are realized when the asset is sold or liability extinguished. Holding gains and losses on unsold assets and unpaid liabilities are unrealized but are recorded as revaluations.\n\n\n2.1.2.25 Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)\nSDRs are an international reserve asset created by the IMF, used to supplement its member countries’ official reserves. SDR holdings represent unconditional rights to obtain foreign exchange or other reserve assets from other IMF members. SDR holdings are classified as reserve assets in while SDR allocations are captured in Other Investments liabilities.\n\n\n2.1.2.26 Valuation Principles\nValuation principles for measuring cross-border transactions and positions are market prices or book values for assets and liabilities.\n\n\n2.1.2.27 Accrual Accounting\nAccrual accounting records flows at the time economic value is created, transformed, exchanged, transferred, or extinguished. This means that flows that imply a change of economic ownership are recorded when ownership passes and services are recorded when provided, irrespective of whether cash was received or paid or was due to be received or paid.\n\n\n2.1.2.28 Market Value\nMarket prices for transactions are defined as amounts of money that willing buyers pay to acquire something from willing sellers; the exchanges are made between independent parties and on the basis of commercial considerations only—sometimes called “at arm’s length”. Transactions in loans, deposits, and other accounts receivable/ payable also should be valued at market prices. Transactions in financial assets and liabilities should be recorded exclusive of any commissions, fees, and taxes whether charged explicitly, included in the purchaser’s price, or deducted from the seller’s proceeds. When market prices for transactions are not observable, valuation according to market-equivalent prices provides approximation to market prices. In such cases, market prices of the same or similar items when such prices exist will provide a good basis for applying the principle of market prices.\n\n\n2.1.2.29 Book Value\nThe value recorded in the enterprises records.\n\n\n2.1.2.30 Nominal Value\nThe outstanding amount the debtor owes to the creditor, which is composed of the outstanding principal amount including any accrued interest. Therefore, the nominal value reflects the sum of funds originally advanced, plus any subsequent advances, plus any interest that has accrued, less any repayments (which includes any payments covering interest accrual). If a debt instrument is denominated in foreign currency, the corresponding nominal value of the instrument in domestic currency also includes holding gains or losses arising from exchange rate changes.\n\n\n2.1.2.31 Amortized value\nThe amortized value of a loan reflects the process of gradual elimination of the liability by regular payments over a specified period of time. On the date of each scheduled payment, amortized value is the same as nominal value, but it may differ from the nominal value on other dates because nominal value includes interest that has accrued and not been paid.\n\n\n2.1.2.32 Face value\nThe undiscounted amount to be paid to the holder at maturity. It is also known as “par value” or simply “par.” Before maturity, the market value of a bond may be greater or lesser than the face value, depending on the interest rate payable and the perceived risk of default. As bonds approach maturity, market value approaches face value. For example, if interest rates are higher than the bond’s coupon rate, then the bond is sold at a discount (below par). Conversely, if interest rates are lower than the bond’s coupon rate, then the bond is sold at a premium (above par).\n\n\n2.1.2.33 Net Errors and Omissions\nIn practice, data may not perfectly match due to various statistical discrepancies, either from source data or from compilation. This gives rise to net errors and omissions. While net errors and omissions is a residual item, the size and trends may help identify data problems, such as coverage or misreporting. Patterns in net errors and omissions may provide useful information on data problems. While it is not possible to have guidelines on an acceptable size for net errors and omissions, it can be assessed in relation to other items, such as GDP, current account balance, positions data, and gross flows.\n\n\n2.1.2.34 Institutional Sectors\nBPM6 provides guidance for compilation of BOP and IIP by attributing institutional units to the following sectors:\n●       Central Bank\n○      Deposit taking Corporations except the Central Bank\n○      General government\n●       Other Sectors\n■       Other financial corporations\n●       Moneymarketfunds(MMFs)\n●       Non-MMF Investment funds\n●       Other financial intermediaries except insurance corporations and pension funds (ICPFs)\n●        Financial auxiliaries\n●       Captive financial institutions and money lenders\n●        Insurance corporations\n●       Pension funds\n■       Non-financial corporations, households, and NPISHs\n●       Nonfinancial corporations\n●        Households\n●       NPISHs (non-profit institutions serving households; maybe combined with households)\nThe full institutional sector detail is required for international accounts to be fully integrated with monetary, flow of funds, and other financial data.\n\n\n2.1.2.35 Exceptional Financing\nBrings together financial arrangements made by the authorities (or by other sectors fostered by authorities) of an economy to meet Balance of Payments needs. Arrears related to exceptional financing are recorded below the line as transactions in the analytical presentation of the Balance of Payments with the corresponding entry in the relevant instrument.\n\n\n2.1.2.36 The International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS)\nThis is a data collection system that obtains data from banks and companies at the level of individual transactions. An ideal ITRS measures: (1) cash transactions with nonresidents that pass through domestic banks; (2) cash transactions that pass-through enterprise accounts with banks abroad; (3) transactions on intercompany accounts with nonresident companies; (4) positions; and (5) noncash transactions.\nStatistics are compiled from forms submitted to/by domestic banks and from forms submitted by companies.\nHowever, the efficacy of the ITRS is based on the legal framework, accounting systems, and foreign exchange regulations of various economies. In Kenya, the ITRS is a major data source on cross border transactions. However, it is not sufficient to address all the BOP requirements hence the use of complimentary data sources, including surveys to enterprises.\n\n\n2.1.2.37 Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition\nThe Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition (BPM6) is a comprehensive set of guidelines published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It provides standards for compiling and presenting Balance of Payments (BOP) and International Investment Positions (IIP).\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Government Finance Statistics\nCovers statistical activities on the general government sector and the broader public sector.

    "text": "2.2 Sectoral statistics\n\n2.2.1 Agriculture, forestry and fishing\n\n2.2.1.1 Agriculture\nThis is the rearing of animals and growing of crops for sustainable livelihood.\n\n\n2.2.1.2 Agricultural Enterprise\nThe type of crops, fodder/pasture, trees, livestock, or fish that are deliberately grown/developed/reared by a farmer, involving use of labor, capital and other inputs either for food consumption or for sale or any other agricultural use. This excludes enterprises grown for leisure, home beauty, landscaping, etc. Also exclude enterprises gathered in natural forests, hunting, etc. Rearing of horses, cats, dogs, etc. for consumption as food or sale or any other agricultural purposes is considered an agricultural enterprise. However, dogs, cats are captured as companion animals.\n\n\n2.2.1.3  Agricultural Holding\nAn agricultural holding is an economic unit of agricultural production under single management comprising all livestock kept and all land used wholly or partly for agricultural production purposes, without regard to title, legal form or size. Single management may be exercised by an individual or household, jointly by two or more individuals or households, by a clan or tribe, or by a juridical person such as a corporation, cooperative or government agency. The holding’s land may consist of one or more parcels, located in one or more separate areas or in one or more territorial or administrative divisions, providing the parcels share the same production means, such as labour, farm buildings, machinery or draught animals. There are two types of agricultural holdings: (i) holdings in the household sector – that is, those operated by household members; and (ii) holdings in the non-household sector, such as corporations and government institutions.\n\n\n2.2.1.4 Agricultural Household\nA household is considered to be an agricultural household when at least one member of the household is operating a holding (farming household) or when the household head, reference person or main income earner is economically active in agriculture.\n\n\n2.2.1.5 Agricultural Holder\nA civil person, group of civil persons or juridical person who makes the major decisions regarding resource use and exercises management control over the agricultural holding operation. The agricultural holder has technical and economic responsibility for the holding and may undertake all responsibilities directly, or delegate responsibilities related to day to day work management to a hired manager. A holder may be resident in the farm (in case of ranches) or on a piece of land in communal areas where ploughing or animal husbandry takes place (in case of pastoral/arable/subsistence farming). The holder may also be resident somewhere else but still making major decisions on the operations of the holding.\n\n\n2.2.1.6 Hired Manager\nThe person who manages an agricultural holding on behalf of the agricultural holder and is responsible for the normal daily financial and production routines of running the holding. The hired manager is a paid employee.\n\n\n2.2.1.7 Farmer\nA person/an individual or company/institution or agency involved in agricultural enterprise, which includes growing of crops/trees/fodder; keeping livestock and or rearing fish under single management. The farmer is the person who exercises overall management or control over the agricultural operations within the farm or holding and takes major decisions regarding the use of resources for farm production as well as utilization of the output or income from the farming enterprise. The farmer is financially responsible for the enterprise, pays the bills, bears all the risks, and makes the profits/loss directly resulting from the farming operations. The farmer may own the holding/land; they may be a tenant (leased in the farm) or they may occupy the land for farming without either owning or paying to the owner for their occupancy (squatter/temporary occupation).\n\n\n2.2.1.8 Statistical Unit\nThe statistical unit for a data collection is the basic unit for which data are collected. For purposes of agricultural data collection, a statistical unit is the agricultural holding.\n\n\n2.2.1.9 Agricultural Season\nIn Kenya, there are usually two agricultural seasons. The Long Rains Season, which runs from 1st March to 31st May and the Short Rains Season that runs from 1st November to 28th February.\n\n\n2.2.1.10 Planting Season\nThe planting season is from October of the previous year to February of the next year.\n\n\n2.2.1.11 Harvesting Season\nThis usually starts in June and ends in August of any given year.\n\n\n2.2.1.12 Rainy Season\nThis is the wet period of the year when most of the region’s average annual rainfall occurs\n\n\n2.2.1.13 Census Reference Year\nThe census reference year is a period of twelve months, usually either a calendar year or an agricultural year, generally encompassing the various time reference dates or periods of data collection for individual census items.\n\n\n2.2.1.14 Census Reference Day\nCensus reference day is a point in time used for livestock numbers and other inventory items.\n\n\n2.2.1.15 Farming Systems\nThe classification of populations of individual farm types that have similar resource bases, enterprise patterns, household livelihoods and constraints, and for which similar development strategies and interventions would be appropriate.\n\n\n2.2.1.16 Commercial Sector\nThe commercial sector involves agricultural operations either on a freehold, leasehold or Tribal Grazing Land Policy (TGLP) ranches.

It typically includes plants that can be roughly cut and fed to animals in either dry or fresh forms. Fodder is commonly used to feed livestock such as cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, camels, and donkeys. It may consist of grasses, legumes, crops like maize, or remnants of harvested grains such as rice and wheat.\n\n\n2.2.1.29 Pasture\nForage plants found in an open area of land and used for feeding livestock through open grazing as opposed to harvesting and cutting. Pastures are usually grasses and legumes that are grazed or fed on by livestock such as cattle, sheep and goats.  There are two main types of pastures, namely: (i) Natural Pasture; grasses and legumes growing naturally on their own and are fed upon by farm animals, e.g. grasses not planted by farmers.  Most natural pastures contain poor quality grasses and legumes but have good regenerative ability; (ii) Established / improved or sown pasture; grasses and legumes deliberately planted and managed by farmers to be fed on by livestock. Most of these pastures are selected because they contain high quality grasses or legumes\n\n\n2.2.1.30 Hay\nStock feeds produced from dry crop residues.\n\n\n2.2.1.31 Silage\nStock feeds produced from green crops at flowering stage.\n\n\n2.2.1.32 Pure Stand\nWhere a single crop is cultivated or planted alone in a plot or field.

Tillers grow separately from the main shoot and may mature to form their own flowers and seeds.\n\n\n2.2.1.36 Weed\nA wild plant/crop growing where it is not wanted.\n\n\n2.2.1.37 Successive Cropping\nThe growing of a given crop or a different crop on a specific plot or filed in successive seasons in an agricultural year/season.\n\n\n2.2.1.38 Shifting Cultivation\nLand utilization method where a particular piece of land is cultivated for a given number of years (x), and then abandoned for a period (greater than x years), sufficient for it to restore its fertility by natural vegetation growth before it is then re-cultivated/planted. The distinguishing characteristic of the shifting cultivation is that neither fertilizers nor manure is used to replace soil fertility.\n\n\n2.2.1.39 Crop Rotation\nThe practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area in a sequence. It means that the succeeding crop belongs to a different family than the previous one. It helps in reducing soil erosion and increases soil fertility and crop yield.\n\n\n2.2.1.40 Land Under Temporary Crops\nIncludes all land used for crops with a less than one-year growing Cycle.\n\n\n2.2.1.41 Land Under Temporary Meadows and Pastures\nLand temporarily cultivated with herbaceous forage crops for mowing or pasture, as part of crop rotation periods of less than five years.\n\n\n2.2.1.42 Land Temporarily Fallow\nArable land at prolonged rest before re-cultivation. This may be part of the holding’s crop rotation system or because the normal crop cannot be planted because of flood damage, lack of water, unavailability of inputs or other reasons.\n\n\n2.2.1.43 Fallow Land\nThe portion of cultivable land owned that is left to rest to regain its fertility (fallow land). This is land not ploughed/planted during the agricultural season but was ploughed / planted during the past year(s). For a piece of land to be regarded as fallow it has to stay at most five years without being ploughed / planted depending on the geographical area and on the ecological zone.\n\n\n2.2.1.44 Land Under Permanent Crops\nLand cultivated with long-term crops which do not have to be replanted for several years; land under trees and shrubs producing flowers, such as roses and jasmine; and nurseries (except those for forest trees, which should be classified under “forest and other wooded land”). Land under permanent crops also includes land used for growing permanent crops under protective cover. Land under permanent meadows and pastures is excluded from land under permanent crops.\n\n\n2.2.1.45 Land Under Permanent Meadows and Pastures\nLand used permanently (five years or more) to grow herbaceous forage crops through cultivation or naturally growing (wild prairie or grazing land).\n\n\n2.2.1.46 Land Under Farm Buildings and Farmyards\nSurfaces occupied by operating farm buildings (hangars, barns, cellars, silos), buildings for animal production (stables, cow sheds, sheep pens, poultry yards) and farmyards. Area under the holder’s house (including the yard around it) is also classified here if it makes up part of the agricultural holding.\n\n\n2.2.1.47 Farm Land\nThis is land used for agricultural purposes. Farm land consists of crop land, pasture land and grazing land.\n\n\n2.2.1.48 Arable Land\nThis is land that is used in most years for growing temporary crops.

The two latter types of areas are parts of bodies of water, usually rented from others for use for aqua cultural purposes.\n\n\n2.2.4.7 Land-Based Aquaculture\nThis is aquaculture practiced in rice fields, ponds, tanks, raceways, and other land areas on the holding.\n\n\n2.2.4.8 In-Land Water / Freshwater Aquaculture\nThis is aquaculture practiced in freshwater sources like dams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs and groundwater. It is commonly practiced in ponds.\n\n\n2.2.4.9 Marine Aquaculture\nAlso known as Mariculture, is the cultivation of fish in saltwater, seawater, such as inshore and open waters and inland. Production comprises different culture ecosystems, earthen ponds, cages and pens, raceways, tanks, and recirculating systems.\n\n\n2.2.4.10 Brackish Water Aquaculture\nAquaculture systems generally installed in estuaries, bays, lagoons. It involves installation of fish farming systems at these water points and culturing of various species of fish up to harvesting stage.\n\n\n2.2.4.11 Cages\nIt involves raising fish and other aquatic animals in enclosures called cages or pens. The cages are made of netting or mesh and are placed in natural bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, or coastal areas. The cages are made of mesh, wood, or net screens and are enclosed on all or most sides, with an opening at the top for feeding.\n\n\n2.2.4.12 Tanks\nStructures used to raise aquatic animals or plants in a controlled environment. They can be small, round, or rectangular and are usually built above ground using materials such as bricks, concrete or plastic. Tanks allow for careful management of fish growth, feeding and health.\n\n\n2.2.4.13 Raceways\nChannels or open water courses used in commercial aquaculture to raise fish in a high-density, intensive system. These are fixed structures that are used for raising aquatic organisms or plants. These structures are elongated, narrow channels, unlike tanks. Raceways are constructed above the ground and designed to allow water to flow continuously through them. This flow of water enables efficient feeding and waste removal.\n\n\n2.2.4.14 Dams\nStagnant waters created as a result of barriers erected to stop or restrict the flow of water or underground streams, sometimes used for integrated aquaculture and energy production. In terms of size, dams are generally larger than 1.0 ha but smaller than 100 ha.\n\n\n2.2.4.15 Pond\nSmall, artificial body of water that is stocked with fish. It can be in form of earthen pond, lined pond, concrete pond or raised ponds.\n\n\n2.2.4.16 Pond Liming\nProcess of adding calcium or calcium and magnesium compounds to a pond to neutralize acidity and improve its productivity. It also acts as disinfectant of the system.\n\n\n2.2.4.17  Fertilization\nProcess of adding nutrients to a pond to increase the number of phytoplankton and other aquatic life, which in turn provides more food for fish.\n\n\n2.2.4.18  Aquaponics\nThe combination of aquaculture and hydroponics. In aquaponics, the nutrient-rich water that results from raising fish provides a source of natural fertilizer for the growing plants. As the plants consume the nutrients, they help to purify the water that the fish live in. A natural microbial process keeps both the fish and plants healthy. Aquaponics therefore produces both fish and organic or chemical free fruits and vegetables, in a dynamic, pond- type ecosystem.\n\n\n2.2.4.19  Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS):\nA way of fish farming or rearing fish at high densities, in green houses or in tanks or in raceways in a “controlled” environment.\n\n\n2.2.4.20  Fishing Craft\nThe means through which fishing ground can be accessed.\n\n\n2.2.4.21  Fishing Gear\nA tool or equipment used to capture fish from the water.

Electricity can be generated through different processes such as the conversion of energy contained in falling or streaming water, wind or waves; the direct conversion of solar radiation through photovoltaic processes in semiconductor devices (solar cells); or by the combustion of fuels.\nIn Kenya, electric power is mainly generated from renewable sources like Geothermal, solar and wind and/or non-renewable sources including thermal sources.\n\n\n2.2.5.2 Main activity producers\nThese are units that produce electricity or heat as their principal activity. Formerly known as public utilities, these enterprises may be privately or publicly owned companies.\n\n\n2.2.5.3 Autoproducers (electricity)\nThese are units that produce electricity, but for which the production is not their principal activity.\n\n\n2.2.5.4 Autoproducers (heat)\nThese are units that produce heat for sale, but for which the production is not their principal activity. Deliveries of fuels for heat generated by a unit for its own purposes are classified as final consumption, and not as transformation inputs.\n\n\n2.2.5.5 Electricity plants\nPlants producing only electricity. The electricity may be obtained directly from natural sources such as hydro, geothermal, wind, tidal, marine, solar energy or from fuel cells, or from the heat obtained from the combustion of fuels or nuclear reactions.\n\n\n2.2.5.6 CHP plants\nPlants that produce both heat and electricity from at least one generating unit in the plant. They are sometimes referred to as “co-generation” plants.\n\n\n2.2.5.7 Heat plants\nPlants (including heat pumps and electric boilers) designed to produce heat only for deliveries to third parties. Deliveries of fuels for heat generated by an autoproducer for its own purposes are classified as final consumption.\n\n\n2.2.5.8 Solar photovoltaics (PV) electricity\nElectricity produced from solar photovoltaics,i.e. by the direct conversion of solar radiation through photovoltaic processes in semiconductor devices (solar cells), including concentrating photovoltaic systems.\n\n\n2.2.5.9 Solar thermal electricity\nElectricity produced from solar heat (both concentrating and non-concentrating).\n\n\n2.2.5.10 Wind electricity\nElectricity produced from devices driven by wind.\n\n\n2.2.5.11 Hydroelectricity\nElectricity produced from devices driven by fresh, flowing or falling water.\n\n\n2.2.5.12 Wave electricity\nElectricity produced from devices driven by the motion of waves.\n\n\n2.2.5.13 Tidal electricity\nElectricity generated from devices driven by tidal currents or the differences of water level caused by tides.\n\n\n2.2.5.14 Other marine electricity\nElectricity generated from devices that exploit sources of marine energy not elsewhere specified.

Heat from non-concentrating solar thermal refers to low temperature heat produced from solar radiation captured by non-concentrating solar thermal systems. The heat can be used for applications, such as space heating, cooling, water heating, district heating and industrial processes.\n\n\n2.2.5.20 Energy Consumers\nIn energy statistics, energy consumers consist of economic units (enterprises and households) that act as final users of energy; they use energy products for energy purposes (heat raising, transportation and electrical services) and/or for non-energy purposes. It should be noted that the economic units belonging to the energy industries that use energy to produce other energy products are excluded from this group. Their energy use, by convention, is not part of the final consumption of energy and is considered separately as energy industries own use\n\n\n2.2.5.21 Transmission\nEnergy transmission refers to the process of transporting electrical energy, typically at high voltages, from power generation sources to substations, and then onward to distribution networks. It’s a crucial part of the electrical power grid, ensuring that electricity generated at power plants can be delivered to where it is needed.\n\n\n2.2.5.22 Distribution\nThe process of delivering energy, primarily electricity, from generation sources to end-users\n\n\n2.2.5.23 Coal mines\nPlants extracting coal through underground or open-cast mining.

They are also known as coal to liquid (CTL) plants.\n\n\n2.2.5.26 Brown coal briquette plants\nPlants manufacturing brown coal briquettes (BKB).\n\n\n2.2.5.27 Gas works (and other conversion to gases)\nPlants manufacturing gases for distribution to the public either directly or after blending with natural gas. Note that the gases are collectively referred to as “gas works gas and other manufactured gases for distribution”; short name—gas works gas. Some gas works may produce coke, as well as gas.\n\n\n2.2.5.28 Gas separation plants:\nPlants involved in the separation of associated gas from crude oil, and/or the separation of condensate, water, impurities and natural gas liquids from natural gas. In addition to the above, the activities of these plants may also involve fractionation of the recovered natural gas liquids.\n\n\n2.2.5.29 Gas-to-liquids (GTL) plants\nPlants in which natural gas is used as a feedstock for the production of liquid fuels. The liquid fuels are usually used as vehicle fuels.

They also include synthesis gas produced from biomass.\n\n\n2.2.5.35 Nuclear fuel extraction and fuel processing plants\nPlants involved in the mining of ores are chiefly valued for their uranium and thorium content, the concentration of such ores, the production of yellowcake, the enrichment of uranium and thorium ores, and/or the production of fuel elements for nuclear reactors.\n\n\n2.2.5.36 Other energy industry not elsewhere specified\nThis is a residual category that refers to any energy industry not covered elsewhere in the list above. One example is the extraction of peat for energy purposes.\n\n\n2.2.5.37 Other energy producers\nEconomic units (including households) that choose, or are forced by circumstance, to produce energy for their own consumption and/or to supply energy to other units, but for which energy production is not their principal activity. These units are engaged in the production, transformation and transmission/distribution of energy as a secondary and/or ancillary activity. This means that the “energy” output generated by these activities and measured in terms of value added does not exceed that of the principal activity of the unit. In the case of ancillary activities, the activities are carried out to support the principal and secondary activity of the unit.\n\n\n2.2.5.38 Production\nThe capture, extraction or manufacture of fuels or energy in forms that are ready for general use. In energy statistics, two types of production are distinguished, primary and secondary.\n●             Primary production is the capture or extraction of fuels or energy from natural energy flows, the biosphere and natural reserves of fossil fuels within the national territory in a form suitable for use. Inert matter removed from the extracted fuels and quantities reinjected, flared or vented are not included. The resulting products are referred to as “primary” products.\n●             Secondary production is the manufacture of energy products through the process of transformation of other fuels or energy, whether primary or secondary. The quantities of secondary fuels reported as production include quantities lost through venting and flaring during and after production.\n\n\n2.2.5.39 Imports of energy products\nAll fuel and other energy products entering the national territory. Goods simply being transported through a country (goods in transit) and goods temporarily admitted are excluded, while re-imports (i.e. domestic goods exported but subsequently readmitted) are included. The bunkering of fuel outside the reference territory by national merchant ships and civil aircraft engaged in international travel is also excluded from imports. Note that the country of origin of energy products should be recorded, where possible, as the country from which goods were imported, but not a transit country.\n\n\n2.2.5.40 Exports of energy products\nAll fuel and other energy products leaving the national territory. Goods simply being transported through a country (goods in transit) and goods temporarily withdrawn are excluded, while re-exports (i.e. foreign goods exported in the same state as previously imported) are included. Also excluded are quantities of fuels delivered for use by merchant ships (including passenger ships) and civil aircraft of all nationalities during international transport of goods and passengers. Note that the country of destination of energy products (i.e. the country of the last known destination as it is known at the time of exportation) should be recorded as a country to which these products are exported to, but not a transit country.\nIt should be noted that the definitions of imports and exports used in energy statistics are those adopted by international merchandise trade statistics for a system of recording known as the general trade system, that is, all energy products entering and leaving the national territory of a country and which add to or are subtracted from the stock of material resources of a country are recorded as energy imports and exports, except for the bunkering of international fleet, which is excluded from trade figures. It should also be noted that, in energy balances, imports and exports exclude nuclear fuels as these are not within the scope of energy balances.\n\n\n2.2.5.41 International marine bunkers\nQuantities of fuels delivered to merchant ships (including passenger ships) of any nationality for consumption during international voyages transporting goods or passengers. International voyages take place when the ports of departure and arrival are in different national territories. Fuels delivered for consumption by ships during domestic transportation, fishing or military uses are not included here, but are considered part of final consumption of energy (see para. 5.94 for domestic navigation). For the purposes of energy statistics, international marine bunkers are not included in exports; they are recorded separately due to their importance, e.g. for the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n2.2.5.42 International aviation bunkers\nQuantities of fuels delivered to civil aircraft of any nationality for consumption during international flights transporting goods or passengers. International flights take place when the ports of departure and arrival are in different national territories. Fuels delivered for consumption by aircraft undertaking domestic or military flights are not included here, but are considered part of final consumption of energy. For the purposes of energy statistics, international aviation bunkers are not included in exports; they are recorded separately due to their importance, e.g. for the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\n2.2.5.43 Stock changes\nFor the purposes of energy statistics, stocks are quantities of energy products that are held on the national territory and can be used to: (a) maintain service under conditions where supply and demand are variable in their timing or amount due to normal market fluctuations, or (b) supplement supply in the case of a supply disruption.Stocks used to manage a supply disruption may be called ”strategic” or “emergency” stocks and are often held separately from stocks designed to meet normal market fluctuations, but both are considered here. Stock changes are defined as the increase (stock build) or decrease (stock draw) in the quantity of stocks over the reporting period and thus are calculated as a difference between the closing and opening stocks.\n\n\n2.2.5.44 Transfers\nEssentially statistical devices to overcome practical classification and presentation issues resulting from changes in use or identity of a product. Transfers comprise products transferred and interproduct transfers. Products transferred refers to the reclassification (renaming) of products, which, for example, is necessary when finished oil products are used as feedstock in refineries. Interproduct transfers refer to the movements of fuels between product categories because of reclassification of a product that no longer meets its original specification. For example, aviation turbine fuel that has deteriorated or has been spoiled may be reclassified as heating kerosene.\n\n\n2.2.5.45 Transformation\nThe process where part or all of the energy content of a product entering a process moves from this product to one or more different products leaving the process (e.g., from coking coal to coke, from crude oil to oil products, or from fuel oil to electricity) (see section D.2 for further discussion).\n\n\n2.2.5.46 Losses\nLosses during the transmission, distribution and transport of fuels, heat and electricity. Losses also include venting and flaring of manufactured gases, losses of geothermal heat after production and pilferage of fuels or electricity. However, production of secondary gases includes quantities subsequently vented or flared. This ensures that a balance can be constructed between the use of the primary fuels from which the gases are derived and the production of the gases.\n\n\n2.2.5.47 Energy industries own use\nThe consumption of fuels and energy for the direct support of the production and preparation for use of fuels and energy, except heat not sold. As such, it covers not only own use by energy industries as defined in para. 5.23, but also by other energy producers. Quantities of fuels transformed into other fuels or energy are not included here, but within transformation; neither are quantities used within parts of the energy industry not directly involved in the activities listed in the definition.\nThese quantities are reported within final consumption.\n\n\n2.2.5.48 Non-energy use\nThe use of energy products as raw materials for the manufacture of products outside the scope of SIEC, as well as for direct uses that do not involve using the products as a source of energy, nor as a transformation input.

It depends on the technical state of the equipment and its ability to operate, and may differ from the Net maximum capacity due to lack of water for hydro capacity, plant maintenance, unanticipated shutdown, or other outages at the time of peak load\n\n\n2.2.5.56.22 Charcoal\nCovers the solid residue of the destructive distillation and pyrolysis of wood and other vegetal material. Since charcoal is a secondary product, its treatment is slightly different from that of the other primary biofuels. Production of charcoal (an output in the transformation process) is offset by the inputs of primary biofuels into the charcoal production process. The losses from this process are included in the transformation processes. Other supply (e.g. trade and stock changes) as well as consumption are aggregated directly with the primary biofuels. In some countries, only primary biofuels are reported.\n\n\n2.2.5.56.23 Coal and coal products\nCOAL (For balances only.)

The domestic/international split should be determined on the basis of port of departure and port of arrival and not by the flag or nationality of the ship. Note that this may include journeys of considerable length between two ports in a country (e.g. San Francisco to Honolulu). Fuel used for ocean, coastal and inland fishing and military consumption are excluded.\n\n\n2.2.5.56.29 Domestic aviation\nIncludes deliveries of aviation fuels to aircraft for domestic aviation - commercial, private, agricultural, etc. It includes use for purposes other than flying, e.g. bench testing of engines, but not airline use of fuel for road transport. The domestic/international split should be determined on the basis of departure and landing locations and not by the nationality of the airline. Note that this may include journeys of considerable length between two airports in a country (e.g. San Francisco to Honolulu). For many countries this incorrectly includes fuel used by domestically owned carriers for outbound international traffic.\n\n\n2.2.5.56.30 Electricity output in GWh\nShows the total number of GWh generated by thermal power plants separated into electricity plants and CHP plants.

    "text": "2.7 International Trade\n\n2.7.1 International Trade\nAlso referred to as foreign trade, refers to the exchange of goods and services across international borders of countries.\n\n\n2.7.2 Informal Cross Border Trade (ICBT)\nThis refers to transactions in goods and services between residents and non-residents that are not captured through the official customs clearance system and therefore not included in the official international trade statistics. They constitute informal exports and imports of goods and services.\n\n\n2.7.3 Customs Territory\nThe territory in which the customs law of a state applies in full\n\n\n2.7.4 Exports\nOutward flow of goods and services from an economic territory to the rest of the world.\n\n\n2.7.5 Domestic Exports/Exports\nGoods produced/manufactured in a country being exported to other countries or sold at aircraft or shipstores.\n\n\n2.7.6 Re-exports\nThese consist of previously imported goods which are subsequently exported to other countries or to aircraft or ship stores in the same form they were imported into the country or after minor operations like packaging.\n\n\n2.7.7 Total Exports\nThis is the sum of Domestic Exports and Re-exports.\n\n\n2.7.8 Imports\nInward flow of goods and services from the rest of the world to an economic territory/country.\n\n\n2.7.9 Imports for Home Use\nImports for home use means imported goods that have been cleared by Custom Authorities to enter the local market. These goods can be either imported directly or released by Customs from bonded warehouses.\n\n\n2.7.10 Trade volume\nThis is the sum of Total Exports and Imports\n\n\n2.7.11 Trade Balance\nThis refers to the total value of goods exported, minus the total value of goods imported by a given economy in a given period of time. A positive trade balance (trade surplus) indicates that a country is exporting more in value terms than it is importing. A negative trade balance (trade deficit) indicates that the country imports more as compared to what it exports.\n\n\n2.7.12 Export-Import Cover ratio\nThis refers to the proportion of total exports to imports. It measures the proportion of import bills financed by export revenues. The higher the better for an economy.\n\n\n2.7.13 Terms of Trade (TOT)\nTerms of Trade measure a country’s export prices relative to its import prices. A higher term of trade means the export prices are increasing faster than import prices and the better for an economy.\n\n\n2.7.14 Principal commodities\nThese are goods that either a country produces in abundance and sells to other nations, generating foreign currency for the country over time or goods that a country needs to buy from other economies because they either don’t produce them locally or lack the capacity to produce them in sufficient quantities.\n\n\n2.7.15 Assessment Date\nThe date on which customs completes assessment of customs duties and other necessary assessments or inspections on the goods traded. It is at this time that a good is considered as an export or an import.\n\n\n2.7.16 Import valuation\nImports are valued on cost insurance freight (cif) basis which means the import value of the commodity includes the cost/price of the goods, the transportation and insurance charges up to the custom frontiers of the importing country.\n\n\n2.7.17 Export valuation\nExports are valued on a free on board (fob) basis which means the export value of the commodity includes the cost/price of the goods, the transportation and insurance charges if any up to the custom frontiers of the exporting country.\n\n\n2.7.18 Trade Agreement\nAn agreement between two countries or more countries setting out the conditions under which trade between or amongst them will be conducted.\n\n\n2.7.19 Common External Tariff (CET)\nThe uniform tariff rates applied by member states of a customs union against non-member states. Kenya is in the EAC Customs Union and therefore applies EAC-CET.\n\n\n2.7.20 Applied Tariff Rate\nThe tariff rates imposed by customs when a good crosses the border."

    "text": "2.8 Prices\n\n2.8.1 Annual Inflation Rate\nThe annual inflation rate is the change in the overall index e.g. Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all items of the relevant month of the current year compared with the overall index for all items of the same month in the previous year expressed as a percentage.\n\n\n2.8.2 Base Effect\nThe base effect refers to the impact of the rise in price level (i.e. last year’s inflation) in the previous year over the corresponding rise in the price levels in the current year (i.e. current inflation). The base effect therefore helps to explain the changes in the annual inflation or the rate at which it diminishes or grows compared to the previous month.\n\n\n2.8.3 Base Period\nPeriod with which all periods are compared, and the value of the period is 100. It is a reference period for all periods in the index. The following types of base periods must be distinguished.\n       i.          Index reference period: this is the period for which the value of the index is set at 100.\n     ii.          Price reference period: the period that provides the prices to which the prices in other periods are compared. The prices of the price reference period appear in the denominators of the price relatives, or price ratios, used to calculate the index.\n   iii.          Weight reference period: this is the period/year for which the expenditure shares serve as the weights for a set of price relatives or elementary price indices.\n\n\n2.8.4  Basket of Goods and Services\nA national set of goods and services, specified in terms of commodity and quantity which are used for the compilation of an index. For the CPI it comprises goods and services that are acquired by households in the base period.\n\n\n2.8.5 Brands\nThe trade name of the item which may be the manufacturer’s name or the name of the item. Note that the same brand name may be used for different items, e.g. cooking oil, maize, salt etc.\n\n\n2.8.6 Central Product Classification (CPC)\nAn international classification of goods and services based on the physical characteristics of goods and services or on the nature of the services rendered.\n\n\n2.8.7 Chain Index\nThis is an index number in which the value of any given period is related to the value of its immediately preceding period.\n\n\n2.8.8 Chaining/Chain Linking\nThe construction of a continuous price series by multiplying together price indices that have been constructed using different weight reference periods. The resulting index is referred to as a chain index.\n\n\n2.8.9 Classification of Individual Consumption according to Purpose (COICOP)\nThis is the international reference classification of household expenditure. The objective of COICOP is to provide a framework of homogeneous categories of goods and services, which are considered a function or purpose of household consumption expenditure. The classification has divisions, groups, classes, sub classes, micro classes and elementary aggregates.\n\n\n2.8.10 Construction Input Price Index (CIPI)\nMeasures change over time in the general level of prices of inputs in the construction of civil engineering and building projects. The inputs include materials, equipment, labour, transport and fuels among others.\n\n\n2.8.11 Consumer Price Index (CPI)\nMeasures change over time in the general level of prices of goods and services that households acquire for the purpose of consumption. The basket relates to a selection of goods and services that is representative of the consumption habits of most households in the country.\n\n\n2.8.12 Consumption\nAny activity in which households use goods and/or services to satisfy their needs and wants but not for business purposes nor for the acquisition of wealth. Thus, investment in all forms of assets is excluded.\n\n\n2.8.13 Core Inflation\nThis is inflation computed from an index derived from the overall CPI which is intended to show the underlying trend in inflation by excluding price movements arising from transient or volatile product groups.\n\n\n2.8.14 Cost of Living Index\nIt is an index that measures differences in the price of goods and services, and allows for substitutions to other items as prices change. It measures the change between two periods in the minimum expenditures that would be required to achieve a constant standard of living (that is level of utility or economic well-being).\n\n\n2.8.15 Elementary Aggregate\nThe lowest level of groups of goods or services for which expenditure weights are assigned and held constant for a fixed period of time. It consists of a relatively homogeneous set of goods and services, with similar characteristics, content, price or price change.\n\n\n2.8.16 Export Import Price Index (XMPI)\nMeasure the overall change in the price component of transactions in goods and services between the residents of an economic territory and residents of the rest of the world.\n\n\n2.8.17 Fixed-Base Index\nThis is where the value of every period in a time series is directly related to the same value of one fixed base period.\n\n\n2.8.18 Headline Inflation Rate\nThis is the total inflation in an economy, for a basket of goods and services, that is, for all items including commodities like food and energy.\n\n\n2.8.19 Index Number\nAn index number is a statistical measure used to evaluate relative changes in a variable or group of variables, such as price, quantity, or value, over time, across different geographical locations, or according to other characteristics.\n\n\n2.8.20 Inflation\nInflation is defined as a sustained increase in the general level of prices for goods and services over a period.\n\n\n2.8.21 Input Producer Price Index\nMeasure of the change in the prices of goods and services bought as intermediate inputs by domestic producers. Covers both domestically produced intermediate inputs and imported intermediate inputs.\n\n\n2.8.22 Item\nAn individual specified good or service in the sample of products selected for pricing.\n\n\n2.8.23 Jevons Price Index\nThis is an elementary price index defined as the un-weighted geometric average of the sample price relatives.\n\n\n2.8.24 Laspyres Index\nA weighted aggregative index showing the ratio of expenditures in the current period (p2q1, where p2 is the current period price and q1 is the base period quantity) to the expenditure in the base period (p1q1, where p1 is the base period price and q1 is the base period quantity) to purchase the identical market basket of items. A laspeyres price index is computed by taking the ratio of the total cost of purchasing a specified group of commodities at current prices to the cost of that same group at base-period prices and multiplying by 100.\n\n\n2.8.25 Modified Laspyres Index\nIn recent years, there has been a further modification of the Laspeyres formula to suit item replacements in the index basket from time to time due to several reasons, including the smooth substitution of new items and frequent weight updates every month. The modification yields the so-called modified Laspeyres’ formula.\n\n\n2.8.26 Monthly Inflation Rate\nThe monthly inflation rate is the percentage change in the index (e.g. CPI) of the relevant month compared to the index of the previous month. The monthly inflation rate reflects short-term changes in the average prices.\n\n\n2.8.27 Outlet\nThis refers to a place where goods and services can be purchased and from where the purchasers’ or list prices of the products sold can be obtained. It may be a shop, a market stall, a catalogue, a website, etc. Also referred to as a “retail outlet”, although it can include wholesale outlets which also sell directly to the consumer.\n\n\n2.8.28 Output Producer Price Index\nMeasure of the change in the prices of goods and services sold as output by domestic producers. Covers both output sold on the domestic market and output sold as exports. Valuation is at basic prices.\n\n\n2.8.29 Price Relative\nA price relative is the ratio of the price of a specific product in one period to the price of the same product in some other period.\n\n\n2.8.30 Producer Price Index (PPI)\nMeasure changes in the prices of domestic produced goods and services. It is a measure of the change in the prices of goods and services either as they leave their place of production or as they enter the production process.\n\n\n2.8.31 Products (also referred to as “commodities)\nThese are goods and services normally intended for sale on the market at a price that is designed to cover their cost of production.\n\n\n2.8.32 Quarterly Inflation Rate\nThe quarterly inflation rate is the percentage change in the index (e.g. CPI) of the relevant quarter compared to the index of the previous quarter. The quarterly inflation rate reflects short -term changes in the average prices.\n\n\n2.8.33 Representative Product\nProduct, or category of products, that accounts for a significant proportion of the total expenditures within an elementary aggregate, and/or for which the average price change is expected to be close to the average for all products within the aggregate, e.g. maize flour may have a larger share than millet flour.\n\n\n2.8.34  Weight\nIt is the relative consumption or production share of an item or group of items to the total consumption of households or production. In a CPI context, weight is the total household consumption expenditure on a given elementary aggregate expressed as a share of total consumption expenditure of all elementary aggregates.\n\n\n2.8.35  Weight of a Product/Service in an Index Basket\nIt is the proportion of total household expenditure on that product/service during the weight reference period. It depicts the relative importance of goods and services in a basket."

    "section": "2.9 Science, technology and innovation",
    "text": "2.9 Science, technology and innovation\n\n2.9.1 Abandoned innovation activities\nInnovation activities of a firm that were abandoned before the implementation of an innovation.\n\n\n2.9.2 Acquisition of machinery, equipment, other capital goods, and software\nThis innovation activity refers to goods specifically purchased for use in product and process innovation activities of the firm. This includes the acquisition of: land and buildings (including major improvements, modifications and repairs); machinery, instruments and equipment (including computer hardware); and computer software. This category only includes the acquisition of capital goods for innovation that is not included in R&D activities.\n\n\n2.9.3  Acquisition of other external knowledge\nThis innovation activity includes the acquisition of rights to use patents and non-patented inventions, licences, disclosures of knowhow, trademarks, designs and patterns from other enterprises and institutions such as universities and government research institutions, other than R&D. Acquisition of external knowledge may also include computer services and other scientific and technical services for product and process innovations activities.\n\n\n2.9.4 All manufacturing firms\nTotal number of firms in the manufacturing industry.\n\n\n2.9.5 Applied research\nOriginal investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge. It is, however, directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective.\n\n\n2.9.6 Basic research\nIt is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular application or use in view.\n\n\n2.9.7 Business enterprise expenditure on R&D (BERD)\nRepresents the component of GERD incurred by units belonging to the Business enterprise sector (see the definition of Business enterprise sector). It is the measure of intramural R&D expenditures within the Business enterprise sector during a specific reference period.\n\n\n2.9.8 Business enterprise sector (for R&D data)\nIn the context of R&D statistics, the business enterprise sector comprises:\na.     All resident corporations, including not only legally incorporated enterprises, regardless of the residence of their shareholders. This group includes all other types of quasi-corporations, i.e. units capable of generating a profit or other financial gain for their owners, recognised by law as separate legal entities from their owners, and set up for purposes of engaging in market production at prices that are economically significant.\nb.     The unincorporated branches of non-resident enterprises are deemed to be resident because they are engaged in production on the economic territory on a long-term basis.\nc.      All resident non-profit institutions (NPIs) that are market producers of goods or services or serve business.\nd.     This sector comprises both private and public enterprises.\n\n\n2.9.9 Business population\nAll firms in the business sector, which can be disaggregated by economic activity and size class.\nCapital R&D expenditures are the annual gross amount paid for the acquisition of fixed assets that are used repeatedly or continuously in the performance of R&D for more than one year. They should be reported in full for the period when they took place, whether acquired or developed in house, and should not be registered as an element of depreciation. The most relevant types of assets used for R&D for which capital R&D expenditures should be compiled are:\na.   Land and buildings\nb.   Machinery and equipment\nc.    Capitalised computer software\nd.   Other intellectual property products.\n\n\n2.9.10 Capitalised computer software (in capital R&D expenditures)\nThis includes the costs of computer software that is used in the performance of R&D for more than one year. It includes longterm licences or the acquisition of separately identifiable computer software, including programme descriptions and supporting materials for both systems and applications software. The production costs (e.g. labour and materials) of internally produced software should be reported. Software from external vendors may be obtained through the outright purchase of rights or licences to use. Software used or licensed for one year or less should be reported under current expenditures.\n\n\n2.9.11 Contracted-out (external) R&D\nAny creative work undertaken to increase the stock of knowledge for developing innovations but performed by other firms (including other firms or subsidiaries within the group) or by public or private research organizations and purchased by the firm.\n\n\n2.9.12 Cooperation for innovation activities\nActive participation in joint innovation projects with other organizations. Pure contracting out of work, where there is no active collaboration, is not regarded as cooperation.\n\n\n2.9.13 Current R&D expenditures\nThese are composed of labour costs and other current costs (including for external R&D personnel) used in R&D. Services and items (including equipment) used and consumed within one year are current expenditures. Annual fees or rents for the use of fixed assets should be included in current expenditures.\n\n\n2.9.14 Degree of novelty - new to the firm\nImplementation by a firm of a new or significantly improved good or service that was already available from its competitors in the market. A product, process, marketing method or organizational method may already have been implemented by other firms, but if it is new to the firm, then it is an innovation for that firm.\n\n\n2.9.15 Degree of novelty - new to the market\nImplementation of a new or significantly improved good or service by a firm on its market before its competitors. The geographical scope of new to the market is subject to the firm’s own view of its operating market and may include both domestic and international firms.\n\n\n2.9.16 Degree of novelty - new to the world\nInnovation is new to the world when the firm is the first to implement the innovation for all markets and industries, domestic and international. New to the world therefore implies a qualitatively greater degree of novelty than new to the market.\n\n\n2.9.17 Engineering and technology (for R&D data)\nEngineering and technology include: civil engineering; electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering; mechanical engineering; chemical engineering; materials engineering; medical engineering; environmental engineering; environmental biotechnology; industrial biotechnology; nano-technology; and other engineering and technologies.\n\n\n2.9.18 Exchange funds for R&D\nExchange funds for R&D are funding flows from one statistical unit to another statistical unit in return for the performance of R&D and the delivery of relevant R&D outcomes. The unit funding the work incurs a delivery risk associated with the uncertainty of the project. Examples of exchange funds activities include R&D purchases (sales from the perspective of the performer), R&D outsourcing and contributions in the context of collaborative R&D agreements.\n\n\n2.9.19 Experimental development\nExperimental development is systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience and producing additional knowledge, which is directed to producing new products or processes or to improving existing products or processes.\n\n\n2.9.20 External R&D funds\nExternal R&D funds are the amount of money spent on R&D that originate outside the control of a reporting unit.\n\n\n2.9.21 External R&D personnel\nExternal R&D personnel (or contributors) are independent (self-employed) or dependent (employee) workers fully integrated into a statistical unit’s R&D projects without formally being persons employed by the same R&D performing statistical unit.\n\n\n2.9.22 Extramural R&D\nAny R&D performed outside of the statistical unit about which information is being reported; its “funds for extramural R&D” should include only internal funds (not from external sources) provided to an outside unit for R&D performance including both where there is an expected compensatory delivery of R&D (exchange or purchase) and where no compensatory delivery is expected (transfer or grant). It may also be noted that such funds for extramural R&D often will include payments for costs other than for R&D, such as cost elements covering depreciation costs, performer profit, delivery charges, etc.\nFields of research and development (FORD) The fields of research and development (FORD) classification is used to classify R&D units and resources by fields of enquiry, namely, broad knowledge domains based primarily on the content of the R&D subject matter. The main fields of R&D are:\na.     Natural sciences\nb.     Engineering and technology\nc.      Medical and health sciences\nd.     Agricultural and veterinary sciences\ne.     Social sciences\nf.       Humanities and the arts.\n\n\n2.9.23 Firms with only abandoned or ongoing innovation activities\nFirms that did not implement innovations but had abandoned or ongoing innovation activities to develop them. Unless otherwise specified, the term covers product or process innovation, regardless of organizational or marketing innovation.\n\n\n2.9.24 Full-time equivalent (FTE) of R&D personnel \nThis is defined as the ratio of working hours actually spent on R&D during a specific reference period (usually a calendar year) divided by the total number of hours conventionally worked in the same period by an individual or by a group. In other words, one full-time equivalent may be thought of as one person-year. Therefore, it is measured by combining two variables: actual involvement in R&D activities and formal engagement on the basis of normative/statutory working hours. FTE is considered to be a true measure of the volume of R&D and also the main R&D personnel statistic for international comparisons.\n\n\n2.9.25 GERD as a percentage of GDP \nGross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) as a percentage of GDP is the total intramural expenditure on R&D performed in the national territory during a specific reference period expressed as a percentage of GDP of the national territory.\n\n\n2.9.26 GERD by fields of research and development\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period, broken down by the fields of research and development. The fields included are:\na.    Natural sciences\nb.    Engineering and technology\nc.    Medical and health sciences\nd.    Agricultural and veterinary sciences\ne.     Social sciences\nf.      Humanities and the arts.\n\n\n2.9.27 GERD by sector of performance\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period, broken down by the institutions corresponding to eac h sector (business enterprise, government, higher education and private non-profit organizations), independent of the source of funds.\n\n\n2.9.28 GERD by source of funds\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period, broken down by current costs (labour costs and other current costs) and capital expenditure (land and buildings, machinery and equipment, capitalised computer software and other intellectual property products).\n\n\n2.9.29 GERD by type of R&D activity\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period, broken down by basic research, applied research and experimental development.\n\n\n2.9.30 GERD in local currency\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period and reported in current national currency (i.e. expenditure at current prices in national currency).\n\n\n2.9.31 GERD in Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs)\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period, expressed in Purchasing Power Parity dollars.\n\n\n2.9.32 GERD per capita\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period per inhabitant.\n\n\n2.9.33 GERD per researcher\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period per researcher.\n\n\n2.9.34 Government budget allocations for R&D (GBARD)\nIt encompasses all spending allocations met from sources of government revenue foreseen within the budget, such as taxation. Spending allocations by extra-budgetary government entities are only within the scope to the extent that their funds are allocated through the budgetary process. Likewise, R&D financing by public corporations is outside the scope of GBARD statistics, as it is based on funds raised within the market and outside the budgetary process. Only in the exceptional case of budgetary provisions for R&D to be carried out or distributed from public corporations should this be counted as part of GBARD.\n\n\n2.9.35 Government expenditure on R&D (GOVERD)\nIt represents the component of GERD incurred by units belonging to the Government sector (see the definition of Government sector). It is the measure of expenditures on intramural R&D within the Government sector during a specific reference period.\nGovernment sector (for R&D data) In the context of R&D statistics, the Government sector consists of the following groups of resident institutional units\na.     All units of central (federal), regional (state) or local (municipal) government, including social security funds, except those units that provide higher education services or fit the description of higher education institutions (see the definition of Higher education sector).\nb.     All non-market NPIs that are controlled by government units that are not part of the Higher education sector.\nc.      This sector does not include public corporations, even when all the equity of such corporations is owned by government units. Public enterprises are included in the Business enterprise sector.\n\n\n2.9.36 Government tax relief for R&D expenditures (GTARD)\nIt describes tax relief provisions that apply to taxpayers strictly as a result of their engagement in R&D performance and/or funding activities, relative to a normal or baseline tax structure.\n\n\n2.9.37 Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) \nIt is total intramural expenditure on R&D performed in the national territory during a specific reference period.\n\n\n2.9.38 Gross national expenditure on R&D (GNERD)\nIt comprises total expenditure on R&D financed by a country’s institutions regardless of where the R&D is performed. As such, it includes R&D performed in the “rest of the world” that is financed by national institutions or residents; it excludes R&D performed within a country that is funded from institutions outside of the national territory (that is, from institutions that are part of the “rest of the world”). GNERD is constructed by adding the domestically financed intramural expenditures of each performing sector plus the R&D performed in the “rest of the world” that is financed by domestic funding sectors.\n\n\n2.9.39 Grossed up results\nResults of the survey extrapolated to the whole target population. Sample survey data represent units in the sample only. Therefore, the sample estimates need to be inflated to represent the whole population of interest. Estimation is the means by which this inflation occurs, also referred to as “grossing up”. Hampering factors for innovation activities Innovation activity may be hampered by a number of factors. There may be reasons for not starting innovation activities at all; there may be factors that slow innovation activities or affect them negatively. These hampering factors include: economic factors, such as high costs or lack of demand; enterprise factors, such as lack of skilled personnel or knowledge; and legal factors, such as regulations or tax rules. Two indicators are calculated:\na.     the percentage of innovation-active firms for which hampering factors were highly important and\nb.     the percentage of non-innovative firms for which hampering factors were highly important.\n\n\n2.9.40 Headcount (HC) of R&D personnel \nThe total number of individuals contributing to intramural R&D, at the level of a statistical unit or at an aggregate level, during a specific reference period (usually a calendar year). That means headcount data reflect the total number of persons who are mainly or partially employed in R&D. The use of HCs is mostly recommended in terms of exploring, usually in percentage terms, the characteristics of R&D personnel.\n\n\n2.9.41 Higher education expenditure on R&D (HERD)\nRepresents the component of GERD incurred by units belonging to the Higher education sector (see the definition of Higher education sector). It is the measure of intramural R&D expenditures within the Higher education sector during a specific period.\nHigher education sector (for R&D data) In the context of R&D statistics, the Higher education sector comprises:\na.     All universities, colleges of technology and other institutions providing formal tertiary education programmes (i.e. ISCED levels 5, 6, 7, or 8), whatever their source of finance or legal status.\nb.     All research institutes, centres, experimental stations and clinics that have their R&D activities under the direct control of, or are administered by, tertiary education institutions.\n\n\n2.9.42 Humanities and the arts (for R&D data)\nHumanities and the arts include: history and archaeology; languages and literature; philosophy, ethics and religion; art (arts, history of arts, performing arts, music); and other humanities.\n\n\n2.9.43 In-house R&D\nAny creative work undertaken within the firm to increase the stock of knowledge for developing innovations (see the Frascati Manual).\n\n\n2.9.44 Innovation\nImplementation of a new or significantly improved product (good or service), or process, or a new marketing method, or a new organizational method. The minimum requirement for an innovation is that the product, process, marketing method or organizational method must be new (or significantly improved in the case of product or process) to the firm.\n\n\n2.9.45 Innovation activities\nAll scientific, technological, organizational, financial, and commercial steps which actually lead, or are intended to lead, to the implementation of innovations. Some innovation activities are themselves innovative, others are not novel activities but are necessary for the implementation of innovations. Innovation activities also include R&D that is not directly related to the development of a specific innovation. The indicator is calculated as a percentage.\n\n\n2.9.46 Innovation-active firms\nFirms that have had innovation activities during the observation period of the innovation survey, including those with ongoing and abandoned activities. In other words, firms that have had innovation activities during the observation period, regardless of whether the activity resulted in the implementation of an innovation, are innovation-active. Unless otherwise specified, the term covers product or process innovation, regardless of organizational or marketing innovation. The indicator is calculated as a percentage.\n\n\n2.9.47 Innovative firms\nAre firms that implemented an innovation. Unless otherwise specified, the term is used to refer to product or process innovative firms, which are also known as product or process innovators. The indicator is calculated as a percentage.\n\n\n2.9.48 Internal R&D funds\nThe amount of money spent on R&D that originate within the control of and are used for R&D at the discretion of a reporting statistical unit. Internal R&D funds do not include R&D funds received from other statistical units explicitly for intramural R&D.\n\n\n2.9.49 Internal R&D personnel\nPersons employed by the statistical unit who contribute to the unit’s intramural R&D activities.\n\n\n2.9.50 Intramural R&D expenditures\nAll current expenditures plus gross fixed capital expenditures for R&D performed within a statistical unit during a specific reference period, whatever the source of funds. Intramural R&D expenditure is synonymous with the performance of R&D within a statistical unit. The aggregation of intramural R&D for all units within a sector is synonymous with the performance of R&D within a sector of the economy; the summation of intramural R&D for all sectors is synonymous with the performance of R&D for the entire economy (GERD).\n\n\n2.9.51 Labour costs (in current R&D expenditures)\nLabour costs, or compensation of employed personnel, comprise annual wages and salaries and all associated costs or fringe benefits, such as bonus payments, stock options, holiday pay, contributions to pension funds. The concept of labour costs also includes other social security payments and payroll taxes.\n\n\n2.9.52 Land and buildings (in capital R&D expenditures)\nInclude land acquired for R&D use (e.g. testing grounds, sites for laboratories and pilot plants) and buildings constructed or purchased for R&D use, including major improvements, modifications and repairs.\n\n\n2.9.53 Level of formal qualification (for R&D data)\nThe International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) provides the basis for classifying R&D personnel by formal qualification. Five classes are recommended for the purposes of R&D statistics. They are defined exclusively by level of education, regardless of the field in which personnel are qualified.\na.     Doctoral or equivalent level: Programmes at ISCED level 8, or doctoral or equivalent level, are designed primarily to lead to an advanced research qualification. Programmes at this level are devoted to advanced study and original research and are typically offered only by research-oriented tertiary educational institutions such as universities. Doctoral programmes exist in both academic and professional fields.\nb.     Master’s or equivalent level: Programmes at level, or Master’s or equivalent level, are often designed to provide participants with advanced academic and/or professional knowledge, skills and competencies, leading to a second degree or equivalent qualification. Programmes at this level may have a substantial research component but do not yet lead to the award of a doctoral qualification. Typically, programmes at this level are theoretically-based but may include practical components and are informed by state of the art research and/or best professional practice. They are traditionally offered by universities and other tertiary educational institutions.\nc.      Bachelor’s or equivalent level: Programmes level, Bachelor’s or equivalent level, are often designed to provide participants with intermediate academic and/or professional knowledge, skills and competencies, leading to a first degree or equivalent qualification. Programmes at this level are typically theoretically-based but may include practical components and are informed by state of the art research and/or best professional practice. They are traditionally offered by universities and equivalent tertiary educational institutions. First degree programmes at this level typically have a duration of three to four years of full-time study at the tertiary level.\nd.     Short-cycle tertiary education: Programmes at level, or short-cycle tertiary education, are often designed to provide participants with professional knowledge, skills and competencies. Typically, they are practically based, occupationally-specific and prepare students to enter the labour market. However, these programmes may also provide a pathway to other tertiary education programmes.\ne.     This includes post-secondary non-tertiary education, upper secondary education and below. Post-secondary non-tertiary education: Post-secondary non-tertiary education provides learning and educational activities building on secondary education preparing for both labour market entry as well as tertiary education. It typically targets students who have completed upper secondary but who want to increase their opportunities either to enter the labour market or to progress to tertiary education. Programmes are often not significantly more advanced than those at upper secondary as they typically serve to broaden rather than deepen knowledge, skills and competencies. It therefore aims at learning below the high level of complexity characteristic of tertiary education.

Example: “Senior researcher” or “Principal investigator” or “Associate professor”.\nc.    Category C: The first grade/post into which a newly qualified doctoral graduate would normally be recruited. Examples: “Researcher” or “Investigator” or “Assistant professor” or “Post-doctoral fellow”.\nd.   Category D: Either doctoral students who are engaged as researchers, or researchers working in posts that do not normally require a doctorate degree. Examples: “Ph.D. students” or “Junior researchers” (without a Ph.D.). Master’s students who are counted as researchers would also fall under this category.”\n\n\n2.9.92 Researchers per million inhabitants\nThe number of professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) during a given year expressed as a proportion of a population of one million.\n\n\n2.9.93 Researchers per thousand employment\nThe number of professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) during a given year expressed as a proportion of 1,000 employed people.\n\n\n2.9.94 Researchers per thousand labour force\nThe number of professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) during a given year expressed as a proportion of a labour force of 1,000 people.\n\n\n2.9.95 Rest of the world (for R&D data)\nIn the context of R&D statistics, the rest of the world (formerly referred to as ‘Abroad’) includes:\na.   All institutions and individuals without a location, place of production or premises within the economic territory on which or from which the unit engages and intends to continue engaging, either indefinitely or over a finite but long period of time, in economic activities and transactions on a significant scale;\nb.   All international organisations and supranational entities including facilities and operations within the country’s borders.\n\n\n2.9.96 Social sciences (for R&D data)\nThis includes psychology and cognitive sciences; economics and business; education; sociology; law; political science; social and economic geography; media and communications; and other social sciences.\n\n\n2.9.97 Social sciences and humanities (for R&D data)\nThese include social sciences: psychology and cognitive sciences; economics and business; education; sociology; law; political science; social and economic geography; media and communications; other social sciences; and- Humanities and the arts: history and archaeology; languages and literature; philosophy, ethics and religion; art (arts, history of arts, performing arts, music); and other humanities.\n\n\n2.9.98 Source of R&D funds \nThis is the unit that provides the funds for R&D performance. Sources may be internal or external to the reporting unit. In surveys and data presentation, external sources are grouped by main sector and relevant subsectors. In broad terms, there are five main sources for R&D funding: Business enterprise, Government, Higher education, Private non-profit and the Rest of the world.\n\n\n2.9.99 Sources of information for innovation activities\nsources that provided information for new innovation projects or contributed to the completion of existing innovation projects. They provide access to knowledge without the need to pay for the knowledge itself, although there may be marginal fees for access (membership in trade associations, attendance at conferences, subscriptions to journals). Open information sources do not provide access to knowledge embodied in machinery or equipment or the right to use knowledge protected by patents and other forms of intellectual property, although the knowledge behind the patent can be accessed through patent databases. Some open sources, such as attendance at fairs or exhibitions, can give access to some tacit knowledge through personal interaction with other participants.\n\n\n2.9.100 Successful innovation activities\nThese are activities of a firm that resulted in the implementation of an innovation (though not necessarily commercially successful).\n\n\n2.9.101 Technicians and equivalent staff \nThese are persons whose main tasks require technical knowledge and experience in one or more fields of engineering, the physical and life sciences, or the social sciences, humanities and the arts. They participate in R&D by performing scientific and technical tasks involving the application of concepts, operational methods and the use of research equipment, normally under the supervision of researchers.\n\n\n2.9.102 Time-use surveys (for R&D data)\nThis is a statistical survey that aims to report data on how people spend their time. If the necessary R&D coefficients cannot be derived from other surveys or administrative data, time-use surveys are the recommended method to derive the necessary information for estimating the R&D component of full-time equivalents (FTEs) and expenditures.\n\n\n2.9.103 Total R&D personnel\nin a statistical unit, these include all persons engaged directly in R&D, whether employed by the statistical unit or external contributors fully integrated into the statistical unit’s R&D activities, as well as those providing direct services for the R&D activities (such as R&D managers, administrators, technicians and clerical staff). Persons providing indirect support and ancillary services, such as canteen, maintenance, administrative and security staff, should be excluded, even though their wages and salaries are included as an overhead cost when measuring R&D expenditure. Two main groups of individuals who potentially contribute to the R&D activities can be identified in a statistical unit: ‘Internal R&D personnel’ and ‘external R&D personnel’. Both groups of R&D personnel are classified according to their R&D function: ‘Researchers’, ‘technicians’ and ‘other supporting staff’. (See the relevant definitions in this glossary).\n\n\n2.9.104 Training for innovative activities\nThese are all the training (including external training) that is required for the development or implementation of product or process innovations.\n\n\n2.9.105 Transfer R&D funds \nThese are funding flows from one statistical unit to another statistical unit to perform R&D that does not require any good or service in return and where the funder is not entitled to any significant rights on the outcome of the R&D it has funded. The unit that provides transfer funds for R&D may impose some conditions on the performer, such as periodic reporting, compliance with the activity or project description as agreed in the terms of the agreement, or even public dissemination of research outcomes. Examples of transfer funds include grants, debt forgiveness, philanthropy, crowd-funding and personal transfers such as gifts and GUF (by convention for international comparisons). To be included as R&D transfer funds, the funds should be intended by the originating source to be used for R&D. Normally, the R&D performer will retain most rights to the outcomes of the R&D, which explains the transfer nature of this R&D funding transaction.\n\n\n2.9.106 Types of costs of R&D\nInclude individual current and capital cost categories for intramural R&D. Types of current costs include labour costs for internal R&D personnel and other current costs (for external R&D personnel, purchases of services, purchases of materials, and other costs not elsewhere classified. Types of capital costs include land and buildings, machinery and equipment, capitalised computer software and other intellectual property products.\n\n\n2.9.107 Types of R&D\nThree types of R&D are considered under the term ‘R&D’: basic research, applied research and experimental development.\n\n\n2.9.108 Types of R&D funds\nThese are the funds to cover the costs of R&D involving significant flows between units, sectors and countries. From the perspective of performance, R&D is conducted by the statistical unit with funds either from the statistical unit’s own sources (internal) or from sources outside of the statistical unit (external). From the perspective of funding, R&D funds pay for either the costs of R&D performance within the statistical unit (intramural) or the costs of R&D performance outside of the statistical unit (extramural). There can be a flow of R&D funds between statistical units either with (exchange) or without (transfer) compensatory return flows of R&D from the performer. See the relevant definitions (on ‘internal’ and ‘external’ sources of R&D funds, ‘intramural’ and ‘extramural’ R&D, and ‘exchange’ and ‘transfer’ categories of funds for R&D) in this glossary."

This also includes killings by individuals or groups not supported by the State when the act was motivated by the victim’s engagement in such activities and/or was met with a lack of due diligence by the State in responding to the harm, with such inaction motivated by the victim’s or associate’s role. It also includes unlawful attacks and destruction in violation of international humanitarian law that result in or are intended to cause the victim’s death.\n\n\n5.2.14 Enforced Disappearance\nThe arrest, detention, abduction, or any other form of deprivation of liberty of a person by State agents or by persons acting with the authorization, support, or acquiescence of the State, where such acts are motivated by the victim’s or an associate’s engagement in activities as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender. The act is followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the victim’s fate or whereabouts, placing them outside the protection of the law.\n\n\n5.2.15 Torture\nAny act whereby severe physical or mental pain or suffering is intentionally inflicted on a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender for purposes such as obtaining information or a confession, punishing, intimidating, coercing them, or for reasons based on discrimination of any kind. This applies when the pain or suffering is inflicted by, or with the consent, instigation, or acquiescence of, a public official or someone acting in an official capacity.\n\n\n5.2.16 Arbitrary Detention\nThe arrest or detention of a person that is not in accordance with national laws either because it lacks a legal basis or does not follow established legal procedures and is motivated by the victim’s or an associate’s engagement in activities as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender. It is considered arbitrary when it is inappropriate, unjust, unreasonable, or unnecessary under the circumstances.\n\n\n5.2.17 Kidnapping\nThe unlawful detention, abduction, or confinement of a person without their consent by individuals or groups not acting with the State’s support or acquiescence, where the State fails to exercise due diligence in responding to the incident. Such failure is motivated by the victim’s or an associate’s engagement in activities as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender.\n\n\n5.2.18 Other Harmful Acts\nOther actions by State actors or by individuals acting with the State’s permission, support, or acquiescence that cause or intend to cause harm, and that are motivated by the victim’s role as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender.\n\n\n5.2.19 Verified Cases\nReported cases that include a minimum set of relevant information about the individuals and circumstances involved, and have been reviewed by mandated bodies or mechanisms, which found reasonable grounds to believe that the individuals were victims of human rights violations or abuses.\n\n\n5.2.20 Discrimination\nAny distinction, exclusion, restriction, or preference either direct or indirect based on prohibited grounds, with the intent or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment, or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis in the political, economic, social, cultural, or other public spheres.\n\n\n5.2.21 Harassment\nA form of discrimination based on prohibited grounds, which may involve words, gestures, or actions that annoy, alarm, demean, intimidate, belittle, humiliate, or embarrass another person, or create a hostile or offensive environment.

    "text": "5.3 Gender Statistics\nGender statistics refer to statistics that adequately reflect differences and inequalities between women and men in all areas of life. Gender statistics are more than just statistics about women or sex-disaggregated data. They include:\n·       Sex-disaggregated data;\n·       Data pertaining specifically to women or men;\n·       Data capturing gender issues, even if they do not explicitly mention gender, sex, or women and men.\n\n5.3.1 Gender\nGender is a socio-cultural construct that defines and determines the roles, responsibilities, entitlements, and limitations of women, men, girls, and boys in society. It influences their societal position and varies across time, space, and context. Gender refers to the roles and expectations assigned by society, not biology.\n\n\n5.3.2 Sex\nSex refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that distinguish females and males. These characteristics are natural, unlike gender, which is socially constructed and shaped by historical, cultural, and relational contexts.\n\n\n5.3.3 Gender Analysis\nGender analysis examines how differences in roles, responsibilities, needs, opportunities, and rights affect women, men, girls, and boys. It analyzes their constraints and the impacts of these differences to inform policies and programs. This analysis highlights gender gaps and supports equitable development planning.\n\n\n5.3.4 Gender Relations\nThese are socially constructed relationships between women and men in a given cultural context. They differ from biological distinctions and influence power dynamics, access to resources, and social positioning.\n\n\n5.3.5 Gender Issues\nGender issues refer to challenges, opportunities, and barriers affecting both women and men, girls and boys. They are not synonymous with women’s issues.\n\n\n5.3.6 Gender-Aware Planning\nThis is the process of incorporating gender considerations into planning and development initiatives. It acknowledges that programs affect women/girls and men/boys differently. The use of sex-disaggregated data is essential in policymaking, planning, budgeting, and decision-making.\n\n\n5.3.7 Gender Inequality\nGender inequality refers to unequal access to resources, opportunities, and benefits for women and men. It hinders individual development, national growth, and societal progress.\n\n\n5.3.8 Gender Statistics\nGender statistics reflect the socio-cultural realities of women, men, girls, and boys. They include sex-disaggregated data and other statistics relevant to gender-related issues.\n\n\n5.3.9 Sex-Disaggregated Data\nData categorized separately for males and females. This disaggregation is essential for identifying inequalities and conducting effective gender analysis.\n\n\n5.3.10 Gender-Disaggregated Data\nData that are broken down by sex and other variables such as age, location, ethnicity, disability, socio-economic status, and education. These distinctions help reveal hidden inequalities.\n\n\n5.3.11 Statistics on Women\nData focused exclusively on women, often used to highlight their situation. However, they do not allow for comparisons with men and cannot fully reveal gender gaps.\n\n\n5.3.12 Gender Bias\nBias arising from decisions or assumptions based on gender, often favoring men or boys over women or girls.\n\n\n5.3.13 Gender Stereotyping\nAssigning specific attributes, characteristics, or roles to individuals solely based on their gender. Stereotyping becomes harmful when it limits opportunities or choices, particularly in education, careers, or personal development.\n\n\n5.3.14 Gender Equality\nThe condition in which women and men, girls and boys have equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities. Gender equality ensures that individuals can realize their full potential without discrimination based on gender.\n\n\n5.3.15 Gender Indicators\nMeasures used to assess progress toward gender equality. These may be quantitative (e.g., statistics, figures) or qualitative (e.g., perceptions, experiences).\n\n\n5.3.16 Gender Equity\nThe principle of fairness in treatment for women and men, accounting for different needs, interests, and experiences. It may require special measures to address historic or systemic disadvantages.\n\n\n5.3.17 Gender Gap\nThe measurable difference between women and men in terms of access to opportunities, resources, and participation in various sectors.\n\n\n5.3.18 Gender Disparities\nStatistical differences, often called gaps, between men and women that reflect unequal conditions or outcomes.\n\n\n5.3.19 Gender Parity\nGender parity is a numerical measure that reflects relative equality in terms of the number and proportion of women and men, or girls and boys. It is commonly calculated as the ratio of female to male values for a given indicator. When the ratio is calculated as male to female instead, the term “sex ratio” is used rather than “gender parity.”\n\n\n5.3.20 Gender Parity Index\nThe Gender Parity Index (GPI) measures the relative access to education of female and male students. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of females to the number of males enrolled at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of education.\n\n\n5.3.21 Gender Development Index (GDI)\nThe GDI is a tool used to measure gender inequalities in the social, cultural, economic, and political spheres. It assesses gender gaps in human development across three key dimensions:\n1.       Health – measured by female and male life expectancy at birth;\n2.     Education – measured by female and male expected years of schooling for children and mean years of schooling for adults aged 25 and above;\n3.      Economic resources – measured by estimated earned income for females and males.\n\n\n5.3.22 Gender Blindness\nGender blindness refers to the failure to recognize that the roles and responsibilities of women/girls and men/boys are socially and culturally constructed. Gender-blind studies, programs, projects, policies, and attitudes maintain the status quo, overlooking diverse needs and roles, and therefore fail to transform unequal gender relations.\n\n\n5.3.23 Gender Roles\nGender roles are social and behavioral norms that a given culture considers appropriate for individuals of a specific sex. These roles often determine traditional tasks and responsibilities assigned to women, men, boys, and girls, and are shaped by factors such as household structure, access to resources, the global economy, conflict, disasters, and local ecological conditions.\n\n\n5.3.24 Gender Norms\nGender norms are the accepted attributes and behaviors associated with male and female identities in a specific society or community at a particular point in time. They establish standards and expectations of how men and women should act. Internalized early in life, gender norms influence lifelong gender socialization and stereotypes.\n\n\n5.3.25 Gender Planning\nGender planning is an approach that acknowledges the different roles of women and men in society and recognizes that their needs often differ.\n\n\n5.3.26 Strategic Gender Needs\nThese are the requirements necessary for women and men to improve their status or position in society. Addressing strategic gender needs enables individuals to move beyond restrictive social roles. For women, these needs may include land rights, decision-making power, equal pay, and access to credit.\n\n\n5.3.27 Gender Relations\nGender relations are a specific subset of social relations that define interactions between men and women as social groups. These relations intersect with other social influences—such as age, ethnicity, race, and religion—to shape individuals’ status and identity. As social constructs, gender relations can be changed.\n\n\n5.3.28 Gender Balance\nGender balance refers to equal participation of women and men in all areas of work and within programs initiated or supported by institutions. Achieving gender balance creates a more inclusive environment, enhances policy and program effectiveness, and strengthens institutional capacity to serve the entire population.\n\n\n5.3.29 Gender Accommodating\nIt’s the awareness of gender differences and the willingness to adjust and adapt policies, programs, or actions accordingly. It is closely related to gender sensitivity.\n\n\n5.3.30 Gender Perspective\nTaking a gender perspective involves considering gender-based differences in any social phenomenon, policy, or process. It emphasizes differences in status and power and examines how gender-based discrimination shapes both immediate needs and long-term interests. In policymaking, a gender perspective ensures that women’s and men’s experiences are equally considered in the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of programs and policies.\n\n\n5.3.31 Gender Mainstreaming\nGender mainstreaming is the systematic integration of a gender perspective into the preparation, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of policies, regulations, and spending programs, with the aim of promoting gender equality and eliminating discrimination.\n\n\n5.3.32 Gender Mainstreaming in Statistics\nThis involves the systematic consideration of gender issues and the elimination of gender-based bias throughout all stages of statistical production.\n\n\n5.3.33 Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)\nAll procedures involving the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.\n\n\n5.3.34 Domestic Violence\nAll acts of physical, sexual, psychological, or economic violence occurring within the family or domestic setting. This applies regardless of biological or legal ties and includes violence between current or former spouses or partners, whether or not they share a residence.\n\n\n5.3.35 Gender-Based Violence (GBV)\nAn umbrella term for any harmful act perpetrated against a person based on socially ascribed gender differences. GBV varies across cultures and regions and includes sexual violence, domestic violence, trafficking, forced or early marriage, harmful traditional practices (e.g., FGM, honor killings, widow inheritance), and more. These acts may occur in both public and private settings.\n\n\n5.3.36 Women’s Issues\nThese refer to the unique opportunities, challenges, and constraints that affect women and girls. Due to inadequate representation at decision-making levels, their needs are often overlooked or inadequately addressed.\n\n\n5.3.37 Women in Development (WID)\nThe WID approach highlights the marginalization of women in development processes. It advocates for the inclusion of women in development initiatives to ensure that they benefit equally from resources and interventions.\n\n\n5.3.38 Empowerment\nRefers to enhancing the personal, political, social, or economic strength of individuals and communities. Women’s empowerment enables them to gain control over their lives through increased awareness, confidence, choice, access to resources, and transformation of discriminatory structures and institutions.\n\n\n5.3.39 Women’s Economic Empowerment\nRefers to enabling women to participate equally in and benefit from decent work, social protection, market access, and control over resources, time, and decision-making. It also involves increasing women’s voice, agency, and participation in economic decisions at all levels, from the household to international institutions."

    "text": "5.4 Special Population Groups\n\n5.4.1 Person with Disability\nA person with a disability is someone who has a long-term physical, psychological, intellectual, or sensory impairment which, in interaction with various barriers, may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.\n\n\n5.4.2 Disability Cash Benefits\nDisability cash benefits refer to financial payments made to individuals who are fully or partially unable to engage in gainful employment due to a disability. The disability may be congenital or acquired as a result of an accident or illness during the individual’s lifetime. These benefits do not include those resulting from prescribed industrial accidents or occupational diseases, which are classified under occupational injury and disease. The provision of goods and services in kind is categorized under services for the elderly and persons with disabilities.\n\n\n5.4.3 Stateless Persons\nStateless persons are individuals who are not recognized as nationals by any state under the operation of its laws; either because they never acquired a nationality or because they lost it without obtaining a new one.\n\n\n5.4.4 Stateless Population, In Situ\nThis refers to stateless individuals who have never crossed an international border but remain in their “own country”- a place where they have long-standing and significant ties, usually through birth or long-term residence. Their statelessness is often the result of shortcomings in the design or implementation of nationality laws.\n\n\n5.4.5 Indigenous Peoples\nIndigenous peoples are communities, groups, or individuals who are descended from the original inhabitants of a country or region, and who retain distinct social, cultural, economic, and political characteristics. They often maintain their own languages, traditions, customs, and institutions and have a strong connection to ancestral lands and natural resources. Indigenous peoples typically identify themselves as such and are recognized by others as belonging to distinct cultural groups. Despite their diversity, they frequently face challenges related to marginalization, land rights, and preservation of cultural heritage.\n\n\n5.4.6 Guardian\nA guardian is an independent adult who safeguards a child’s best interests and general well-being and complements the child’s limited legal capacity.\n\n\n5.4.7 Unaccompanied Child\nAn unaccompanied child is one who has been separated from both parents and other relatives and is not being cared for by an adult who, by law or custom, is responsible for doing so.\n\n\n5.4.8 Alternative Care (Child Protection)\nAlternative care refers to arrangements made for children who are temporarily or permanently deprived of their family environment or whose best interests require placement outside their family.\n\n\n5.4.9 Best Interests of the Child Principle\nAs stated in Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC): “In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.”\n\n\n5.4.10 Justice for Children\nJustice for children refers to a United Nations framework and set of guiding principles aimed at ensuring that justice systems better serve and protect children. It promotes full adherence to international norms and standards for all children who come into contact with justice or related systems, whether as victims, witnesses, alleged offenders, or for matters involving care, custody, or protection.\n\n\n5.4.11 Juvenile Justice\nJuvenile justice is a justice system designed specifically for children or young persons who are considered juveniles under the respective legal system. It ensures that offenses committed by juveniles are addressed in a manner distinct from how adult offenses are treated. Age limits defining juveniles vary by country.\n\n\n5.4.12 Older Person\nAccording to the United Nations, an older person is someone aged 60 years or older. However, in many communities, age is also determined by socio-cultural markers such as family status (e.g., being a grandparent), physical appearance (e.g., grey hair, wrinkles), or age-related health conditions.\n\n\n5.4.13 Youth\nThere is no universally agreed international definition of “youth.” For statistical purposes, however, the United Nations defines youth as individuals between the ages of 15 and 24 years, without prejudice to definitions adopted by individual Member States.\n\n\n5.4.14 Person of Concern\nThis term traditionally refers to all individuals for whom the UNHCR is mandated to provide protection, assistance, and durable solutions. It includes refugees, asylum-seekers, refugee returnees, stateless persons, and—in many situations—internally displaced persons (IDPs), including those supported by State and non-State partners."

    "section": "5.5 Living Conditions and Poverty",
    "text": "5.5 Living Conditions and Poverty\nLiving conditions are the circumstances or factors affecting the way in which people live, particularly with regard to their well-being. The term ‘living conditions’ is closely related to that of ’quality of life.\nPoverty is a state or condition in which an individual lacks the financial resources and essentials for a basic standard of living.\n\n5.5.1 Welfare Analysis\nWelfare analysis, in economics, is the study of how policies or market changes affect the well-being of individuals and society, primarily by measuring the net benefits to consumers and producers.\n\n\n5.5.2 Poverty\nPoverty is a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, such as food, clean water, shelter, education, and healthcare (monetary and non-monetary). It typically results from a lack of access to resources or opportunities to improve one’s economic situation. Poverty is often measured by income levels, with individuals or households falling below a certain income threshold considered to be in poverty. However, poverty also encompasses other dimensions, including social exclusion, lack of access to essential services, and limited opportunities for economic and social advancement.\n\n\n5.5.3 Household Expenditure\nHousehold expenditure refers to the total spending by a person living alone or a group of people living together on goods and services within a specific time period.\n\n\n5.5.4 Household Consumption\nHousehold consumption is the quantity of goods and services that the household enjoys in a given period.\n\n\n5.5.5 Household Consumption Expenditure\nHousehold consumption expenditure includes those money outlays directed toward consumption (e.g., it excludes outlays for investment purposes).\n\n\n5.5.6 Data Used in Analysis\nData used in analysis refers to the specific information, collected and prepared, that is subjected to various techniques and methods to extract meaningful insights, support decision-making, and draw conclusions. It encompasses raw data that has been organized, cleaned, and potentially transformed to make it suitable for analysis.\n\n\n5.5.7 Recall Period\nThe recall period in an interview refers to the specific timeframe that respondents are asked to remember or reflect upon when providing information. It is a key aspect in survey design, especially in interviews related to data collection on behaviors, expenditures, or experiences.\nIn an interview about household income, the recall period might be “the last month” or “the past year,” and respondents would be asked to report their income or expenditures during that specific period. The choice of recall period is important because it affects the accuracy and reliability of the responses. If the recall period is too long, respondents may forget details or provide inaccurate information. If it is too short, the information might not capture enough relevant data to make meaningful conclusions.\n\n\n5.5.8 -Day Recall Period\nRecall interviews with a 7-day recall period are used for the collection of food consumption data, as this method provides a good balance between accuracy and cost-effectiveness.\n\n\n5.5.9 1-Month Recall Period\nRecall interviews with a 1-month recall period are used for the collection of frequent non-food consumption data.\n\n\n5.5.10 6-Month Recall Period\nRecall interviews with a 6-month recall period are used for the collection of less frequent non-food consumption data.\n\n\n5.5.11 1-Year Recall Period\nRecall interviews with a 1-year recall period are used for the collection of durable goods consumption data.\n\n\n5.5.12 Nominal Consumption Aggregate (NCA)\nThe computation of a consumption-based welfare measure consists of assembling the so-called nominal consumption aggregate (NCA) from survey data. NCA is defined as the value of all goods and services consumed by members of the household during the reference period (see Household Consumption Expenditure).\n\n\n5.5.13 Modes of Acquisition\nAll surveys should collect data on all main modes of food acquisition, namely:\n a) Purchases;\n b) Household’s own production; and\n c) Received in kind/gifts, etc.\n\n\n5.5.14 Household’s Own Production\nFood from own production includes products usually sold as part of a household’s main commercial enterprise that are instead reserved for consumption (farm households are a typical example), as well as non-commercial and subsistence food production, and food acquired from hunting, fishing, and gathering.\n\n\n5.5.15 Food Received in Kind\nFood received in kind in the form of transfers from other households, the private sector, or the government.\n\n\n5.5.16 Food Away from Home\n“Food away from home” generally refers to food prepared away from home, regardless of whether the food is consumed outside or inside the home. This includes meals and snacks purchased from restaurants and other commercial establishments (including takeout meals), received in-kind at school, at work, from other households, etc.\n\n\n5.5.17 Non-Food Non-Durable Items\nThe non-food non-durable items of the non-food component of the NCA will include all the items in Division 03 “Clothing and Footwear” through to Category 13 “Personal Care, Social Protection, and Miscellaneous Goods,” referencing the Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP), the international reference classification of household expenditures (United Nations, 2018).\n\n\n5.5.18 Durable Goods (Items)\nThe durable goods/items of the non-food component of the NCA include those defined by their durability—meaning their ability to deliver useful services through repeated use over an extended period. Examples include automobiles, household appliances, and electronic devices.\n\n\n5.5.19 Hedonic Rent Imputation – Housing Component of the NCA\nHedonic rent imputation is a method used in economic analysis to estimate the value of housing or real estate, accounting for attributes that influence price, such as location, size, amenities, and condition. The “hedonic pricing model” assumes the price of a good (in this case, housing) is determined by the sum of the values of its individual characteristics.\n\n\n5.5.20 Adjusting for Price Variation\nAdjusting for price variation refers to accounting for differences in prices over time or across locations when comparing economic data, such as income, expenditure, or living standards. This adjustment—using either Paasche or Laspeyres price deflators—eliminates the influence of price changes or regional disparities to enable like-for-like comparisons.\n\n\n5.5.21 Adjusting for Household Size and Composition\nThis refers to modifying economic indicators (such as income or expenditure) to account for differences in the number and characteristics of household members (e.g., age, gender) using equivalence scales or consumption needs.\n\n\n5.5.22 Poverty Profile\nA description of how the extent of poverty varies across sub-groups of a given population, characterized by gender, geographical location, type of economic activity, income source, etc.\n\n\n5.5.23 Poverty Line\nThe poverty line is a monetary threshold determined at a specific time and location, representing the minimum level of income or consumption expenditure required to meet basic needs, including food, housing, clothing, and healthcare.\n\n\n5.5.24 The Food Poverty Line\nThe food poverty line represents the minimum monetary threshold in Kenyan Shillings required to meet nutritional needs based on consumption patterns. It is calculated based on food that provides 2,250 Kcal per adult equivalent per day, over a 30-day period.\n\n\n5.5.25 Absolute Poverty/Overall Poverty Line\nThe monetary threshold in Kenyan Shillings required to purchase a combination of food and non-food items per adult equivalent per month.\n\n\n5.5.26 Food Poverty\nIndividuals (or households, if estimated at the household level) whose food consumption per adult equivalent falls below the food poverty line in rural or urban areas are considered food poor or in “food poverty.”\n\n\n5.5.27 Overall (Absolute) Poverty\nIndividuals (or households) whose total (food and non-food) consumption per adult equivalent falls below the overall poverty line are considered in “overall poverty.”\n\n\n5.5.28 Hardcore (Extreme) Poverty\nIndividuals (or households) whose total consumption per adult equivalent is below the food poverty line are considered in “hardcore poverty.”\n\n\n5.5.29 The Headcount Ratio (HCR or P0)/Headcount Ratio (H)\nThe proportion of individuals (or households) whose total consumption falls below the poverty line. It is the most commonly used measure of poverty due to its simplicity and ease of interpretation.\n\n\n5.5.30 Poverty Gap (P1)\nThe poverty gap index measures the average shortfall from the poverty line as a percentage. It reflects the mean distance of the poor from the poverty line, with those above the line considered to have zero shortfall. It also indicates the minimum cost to eliminate poverty under perfect targeting.\n\n\n5.5.31 Squared Poverty Gap/Severity of Poverty\nThis index squares each poverty gap before averaging, placing greater weight on the poorest. It accounts for inequality among the poor. Proposed by Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (1984), it is part of a class of poverty measures varying the weight of deprivation severity.\n\n\n5.5.32 The Gini Index\nThe Gini coefficient measures inequality in consumption expenditure. A value of 0 indicates perfect equality, while a value of 100 indicates maximum inequality (i.e., one individual has all the expenditure).\n\n\n5.5.33 Multidimensional Poverty\nA measure of poverty that considers factors beyond income, such as education, health, and living standards."

    "section": "5.6 Climate Change",
    "text": "5.6 Climate Change\nClimate change refers to any significant change in the measures of climate lasting for an extended period of time. In other words, climate change includes major changes in temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns, among others, that occur over several decades or longer. It is attributed directly or indirectly to human (anthropogenic) activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere. The term is frequently used in reference to global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activities.\n\n5.6.1 Climate\nRefers to the condition of the atmosphere at a particular location (microclimate) or region over a long period of time. It is the long-term summation of atmospheric elements – such as solar radiation, temperature, humidity, precipitation type (frequency and amount), atmospheric pressure, and wind (speed and direction) – and their variations.\n\n\n5.6.2 Weather\nWeather is the state of the atmosphere of a given place at a given time. The elements of weather include, but are not limited to, rainfall, temperature, pressure, wind, cloud cover, and humidity.\n\n\n5.6.3 Environment\nThe totality of all the external conditions (physical, biological, and socio-economic) affecting the life, development, and survival of an organism.\n\n\n5.6.4 Climate Model\nA numerical representation of the climate system based on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of its components, their interactions, and feedback processes, and accounting for some of its known properties. The climate system can be represented by models of varying complexity; that is, for any one component or combination of components, a spectrum or hierarchy of models can be identified, differing in such aspects as the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to which physical, chemical, or biological processes are explicitly represented, or the level at which empirical parametrizations are involved.\n\n\n5.6.5 Climate Prediction\nA probabilistic statement about future climate conditions on timescales ranging from seasons to decades. It is based on conditions known at present and assumptions about the physical processes that will determine future changes. When a projection is branded “most likely,” it becomes a prediction, and outputs of which can enable some level of confidence to be attached to projections.\n\n\n5.6.6 Climate Projection\nThe simulated response of the climate system to a scenario of future emissions or concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols, generally derived using climate models. Projections provide a potential future evolution of a quantity or set of quantities, often computed with the aid of a model. Climate projections are distinguished from climate predictions by their dependence on the emission/concentration/radiative forcing scenario used, which is, in turn, based on assumptions concerning, for example, future socio-economic and technological developments that may or may not be realized.

    "text": "5.7 Regional and Small Area Statistics\n\n5.7.1 Direct Estimator\nA direct estimator uses data from a survey exclusively from an area to estimate an indicator for that area (i.e., the estimate is produced using only survey data). When the precision of the direct estimate is not adequate, oversampling within the domain or applying statistical techniques that allow reliable estimates in the domain may be necessary.\n\n\n5.7.2 Population of Interest\nThe population for which the survey is designed, for example, households or persons living in a specific county or region.\n\n\n5.7.3 Unit of Analysis\nRefers to the level at which a measurement is taken—for example, persons, households, farms, or establishments.\n\n\n5.7.4 Variable of Interest / Target Variable / Dependent Variable\nThe information of interest to be captured by the survey, for example, consumption expenditure.\n\n\n5.7.5 Auxiliary Variables / Auxiliary Information / Covariate\nVariables that affect the variables of interest, for example, age, education, sex, religion, etc.\n\n\n5.7.6 Domain / Area\nA domain or area is defined as the subdivision for which estimations are desired. These can be planned domains (e.g., counties) or unplanned designs (e.g., sub-counties). “Areas” can be geographic or socio-economic delimitations or the result of cross-tabulating the two. Examples include geographic areas (state, county, school district, health service area), socio-demographic groups, or both (e.g., a specific age-sex-race group within a large geographic area), or other subpopulations (e.g., a set of firms belonging to a census division by industry group).\n\n\n5.7.7 Small Area Estimation\nSmall area estimation is a set of methods used to achieve estimates of acceptable quality for publication. As statistical information is disaggregated into smaller population subgroups, it becomes noisier and yields larger coefficients of variation (CV), which may exceed the threshold established by the National Statistical Offices (NSO), above which they may choose not to publish that specific estimate.\n\n\n5.7.8 Model-Based Small Area Estimates\nModel-based small area estimates rely on statistical models to establish a relationship between a dependent variable and a set of covariates. The covariates and parameters obtained from the fitted model are then used to predict the dependent variable in the auxiliary data. In the context of small area estimates of poverty under unit-level models, the dependent variable is typically consumption, expenditure, or income, and the method relies on properly replicating the welfare distribution.\n\n\n5.7.9 Area-Level Models\nIn small area estimation methodologies, area-level models use only aggregate auxiliary information at the area level. Aggregated data are more readily available because they are typically not subject to confidentiality restrictions.\n\n\n5.7.10 Unit-Level Models\nUnit-level models refer to models where detailed unit-record data are available—for example, detailed income/expenditure information from household surveys and a set of household-level characteristics available in both a household survey and a population census—to simulate household expenditures or incomes for each household in the population census data."

    "text": "5.9 Circular Economy\nThe circular economy is a model of production and consumption that involves sharing, leasing, reusing, repairing, refurbishing, and recycling existing materials and products for as long as possible. In this way, the life cycle of products is extended. In practice, it implies reducing waste to a minimum. When a product reaches the end of its life, its materials are kept within the economy wherever possible through recycling. These materials can be productively used again and again, thereby creating further value. In essence, the circular economy is a system where materials never become waste and nature is regenerated."

The categories at each level of the classification structure must be mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive of all objects in the population of interest.\n\n6.2.1 Broad Economic Category (BEC)\n A classification, which groups commodities according to their main end use.\n\n\n6.2.2 Central Product Classification (CPC)\nA classification based on the physical characteristics of goods or on the nature of the services rendered. Each type of good or service distinguished in the CPC is defined in such a way that it is normally produced by only one activity as defined in ISIC. The CPC covers products that are an output of economic activities, including transportable goods, non-transportable goods and services.\n\n\n6.2.3 Classification of Functions of Government (COFOG)\nA classification used to identify the socio-economic objectives of current transactions, capital outlays and acquisition of financial assets by general government and its sub-sectors\n\n\n6.2.4 Classification of Individual Consumption according to Purpose (COICOP)\nA classification used to classify individual consumption expenditures by households, non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs), and general government according to their purpose.\n\n\n6.2.5 Classification of Statistical Activities (CSA)\nAn analytical classification that provides a hierarchical structure of categories about statistical activities. It is organized by statistical domains, which can be further broken down into sub-domains and specific activities.\n\n\n6.2.6 Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System (HS)\nThe HS is an internationally adopted commodity classification system developed by the World Customs Organization (WCO). It provides a detailed nomenclature for classifying traded goods based on their nature, primarily to meet customs and statistical requirements.\n\n\n6.2.7 Standard International Trade Classification (SITC)\nIt is an international classification system for traded goods developed by the United Nations. It classifies commodities based on criteria such as materials used, processing stage, market practices, and economic significance, making it particularly suitable for economic analysis and international trade comparisons. Unlike the HS, which is focused on the nature of the commodity for customs purposes, the SITC groups products by their stage of production to support analytical applications.\n\n\n6.2.8 International Classification of Disease (ICD)\nThis is an international standard for recording, reporting, and monitoring diseases and health conditions. It provides a common language for health professionals worldwide and enables the systematic classification of diseases, disorders, injuries, and other health-related conditions.\n\n\n6.2.9 International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities (ISIC)\nIt is a coherent and consistent classification structure of economic activities based on a set of internationally agreed concepts, definitions, principles and classification rules. It provides a comprehensive framework within which economic data can be collected and reported in a format that is designed for purposes of economic analysis, decision-taking and policy-making.\n\n\n6.2.10 Kenya Standard Industrial Classification (KeSIC) of All Economic Activities\nThis is a domesticated version of the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC Rev. 4), modified to suit Kenya’s specific economic context. Notable changes include the introduction of 52 new classes, 973 sub-class 1 codes, and 1,180 sub-class 2 codes, which allow for a deeper disaggregation of economic activities unique to Kenya. It also includes categories to capture the informal and subsistence activities.\n\n\n6.2.11 International Classification of Activities for Time-Use Statistics (ICATUS)\nThis is a classification of all the activities on which a person may spend time during the 24 hours that make up a day. Its purpose is to serve as a standard framework for time-use statistics based on activities grouped in a meaningful way.\n\n\n6.2.12 International Standard Classification of Occupation (ISCO)\nA system for classifying and aggregating jobs and occupations into groups according to the tasks and duties undertaken in the job. The system classifies persons according to their actual and potential relation with jobs. Jobs are classified with respect to the type of work performed or to be performed. The basic criteria used to define the system of major, sub-major, minor and unit groups is the ‘skill’ level and ‘skill specialisation’ required to carry out the tasks and duties of the occupations\n\n\n6.2.13 Kenya National Occupational Classifications (KNOCS)\nThis is a system used to categorize and classify jobs within the Kenyan labor market. It’s designed to standardize the way occupations are defined and organized, facilitating the collection and analysis of labor market information. KNOCS is modeled on the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO).\n\n\n6.2.14 International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED)\nA comprehensive framework for organizing education programmes and qualifications by applying uniform and internationally agreed definitions to facilitate comparisons of education systems across countries\n\n\n6.2.15 International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Standards\nIt is a standard that provides the fundamentals and vocabulary for quality management systems (QMS). It establishes the essential principles and terminology to help organizations ensure their products and services consistently meet customer and regulatory requirements.\n\n\n6.2.16 System of National Accounts (SNA)\nThis is the internationally agreed standard set of recommendations on how to compile measures of economic activity in accordance with strict accounting conventions based on economic principles. The recommendations are expressed in terms of a set of concepts, definitions, classifications and accounting rules that comprise the internationally agreed standard for measuring such items as gross domestic product (GDP), the most frequently quoted indicator of economic performance. The accounting framework of the SNA allows economic data to be compiled and presented in a format that is designed for purposes of economic analysis, decision-taking and policymaking. The accounts themselves present in a condensed way a great mass of detailed information, organized according to economic principles and perceptions, about the working of an economy.\n\n\n6.2.17 International Standard Book Number (ISBN)\nThis is a unique identifier for books, eBooks, and other published materials. It serves as a standardized way to identify a particular edition of a book and is used by publishers, booksellers, libraries, and distributors to efficiently manage and locate specific titles in the global marketplace.\n\n\n6.2.18 Digital Object Identifier (DOI)\nA unique, persistent identifying number for online information resources that provides its permanent, precise identifier regardless of its location on the Internet."

More broadly interpreted, an SBR is these data together with the procedures, systems and human resources that support their use. In operational terms, it is a regularly updated, structured database that contains organizational, administrative and statistical units describing businesses in a country or region, that is maintained by a dedicated staff, supported by a purpose-built software system and that is used by an NSO to create frames for business surveys and sometimes as a direct source of counts of businesses by type, size, geography, economic activity, etc.\n\n\n6.3.1.2 Institutional unit\nAn entity that is capable, in its own right, of owning assets, incurring liabilities and engaging in economic activities and in transactions with other entities.

    "text": "Statistical metadata are data and other documentation that describe statistical data and statistical processes in a standardized way by providing information on data sources, methods, definitions, classifications and data quality.\n\n\nA Set of technical standards and content-oriented guidelines, together with an IT architecture and tools, to be used for the efficient exchange and sharing of statistical data and metadata.\n\n\n\nAn SDMX guideline containing concepts and related definitions that are useful for building and understanding data and metadata exchange arrangements based on SDMX.\n\n\n\nA Set of structural metadata associated to a Data Set, which includes information about how concepts are associated with the Measures, Dimensions, and Attributes of a data cube, along with information about the Representation of data and related descriptive metadata.\n\n\n\nTechnical infrastructure containing publicly available metadata material, data structure definitions (DSD), and related artefacts (concept schemes, metadata structure definitions, code lists, etc.).\n\n\n\nAn international standard for describing metadata from surveys, questionnaires, statistical data files, and social sciences study-level information. DDI focuses on microdata and tabulation of aggregates /indicators.\n\n\n\nA conceptual model that provides a set of standardized information objects, inputs and outputs in the design and production of statistics, regardless of the subject matter.\n\n\n\nA standard that describes and defines the set of business processes needed to produce official statistics. The customized model used by the KNBS is known as Kenya Statistical Process Model (KSPM).\n\n\n\nData about the processes by which statistics are compiled.\n\n\n\n\nA set of categories which may be assigned to one or more variables registered in statistical surveys or administrative files, and used in the production and dissemination of statistics. The categories are defined in terms of one or more characteristics of a particular population of units of observation. A statistical classification may have a flat, linear structure or may be hierarchically structured, such that all categories at lower levels are sub-categories of a category at the next level up. The categories at each level of the classification structure must be mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive of all objects in the population of interest.\n\n\nA classification, which groups commodities according to their main end use.\n\n\n\nA classification based on the physical characteristics of goods or on the nature of the services rendered. Each type of good or service distinguished in the CPC is defined in such a way that it is normally produced by only one activity as defined in ISIC. The CPC covers products that are an output of economic activities, including transportable goods, non-transportable goods and services.\n\n\n\nA classification used to identify the socio-economic objectives of current transactions, capital outlays and acquisition of financial assets by general government and its sub-sectors\n\n\n\nA classification used to classify individual consumption expenditures by households, non-profit institutions serving households (NPISHs), and general government according to their purpose.\n\n\n\nAn analytical classification that provides a hierarchical structure of categories about statistical activities. It is organized by statistical domains, which can be further broken down into sub-domains and specific activities.\n\n\n\nThe HS is an internationally adopted commodity classification system developed by the World Customs Organization (WCO). It provides a detailed nomenclature for classifying traded goods based on their nature, primarily to meet customs and statistical requirements.\n\n\n\nIt is an international classification system for traded goods developed by the United Nations. It classifies commodities based on criteria such as materials used, processing stage, market practices, and economic significance, making it particularly suitable for economic analysis and international trade comparisons. Unlike the HS, which is focused on the nature of the commodity for customs purposes, the SITC groups products by their stage of production to support analytical applications.\n\n\n\nThis is an international standard for recording, reporting, and monitoring diseases and health conditions. It provides a common language for health professionals worldwide and enables the systematic classification of diseases, disorders, injuries, and other health-related conditions.\n\n\n\nIt is a coherent and consistent classification structure of economic activities based on a set of internationally agreed concepts, definitions, principles and classification rules. It provides a comprehensive framework within which economic data can be collected and reported in a format that is designed for purposes of economic analysis, decision-taking and policy-making.\n\n\n\nThis is a domesticated version of the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC Rev. 4), modified to suit Kenya’s specific economic context. Notable changes include the introduction of 52 new classes, 973 sub-class 1 codes, and 1,180 sub-class 2 codes, which allow for a deeper disaggregation of economic activities unique to Kenya. It also includes categories to capture the informal and subsistence activities.\n\n\n\nThis is a classification of all the activities on which a person may spend time during the 24 hours that make up a day. Its purpose is to serve as a standard framework for time-use statistics based on activities grouped in a meaningful way.\n\n\n\nA system for classifying and aggregating jobs and occupations into groups according to the tasks and duties undertaken in the job. The system classifies persons according to their actual and potential relation with jobs. Jobs are classified with respect to the type of work performed or to be performed. The basic criteria used to define the system of major, sub-major, minor and unit groups is the ‘skill’ level and ‘skill specialisation’ required to carry out the tasks and duties of the occupations\n\n\n\nThis is a system used to categorize and classify jobs within the Kenyan labor market. It’s designed to standardize the way occupations are defined and organized, facilitating the collection and analysis of labor market information. KNOCS is modeled on the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO).\n\n\n\nA comprehensive framework for organizing education programmes and qualifications by applying uniform and internationally agreed definitions to facilitate comparisons of education systems across countries\n\n\n\nIt is a standard that provides the fundamentals and vocabulary for quality management systems (QMS). It establishes the essential principles and terminology to help organizations ensure their products and services consistently meet customer and regulatory requirements.\n\n\n\nThis is the internationally agreed standard set of recommendations on how to compile measures of economic activity in accordance with strict accounting conventions based on economic principles. The recommendations are expressed in terms of a set of concepts, definitions, classifications and accounting rules that comprise the internationally agreed standard for measuring such items as gross domestic product (GDP), the most frequently quoted indicator of economic performance. The accounting framework of the SNA allows economic data to be compiled and presented in a format that is designed for purposes of economic analysis, decision-taking and policymaking. The accounts themselves present in a condensed way a great mass of detailed information, organized according to economic principles and perceptions, about the working of an economy.\n\n\n\nThis is a unique identifier for books, eBooks, and other published materials. It serves as a standardized way to identify a particular edition of a book and is used by publishers, booksellers, libraries, and distributors to efficiently manage and locate specific titles in the global marketplace.\n\n\n\nA unique, persistent identifying number for online information resources that provides its permanent, precise identifier regardless of its location on the Internet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA statistical business register (SBR) is a set of businesses, including all the characteristics of those businesses required to provide frames for business surveys. More broadly interpreted, an SBR is these data together with the procedures, systems and human resources that support their use. In operational terms, it is a regularly updated, structured database that contains organizational, administrative and statistical units describing businesses in a country or region, that is maintained by a dedicated staff, supported by a purpose-built software system and that is used by an NSO to create frames for business surveys and sometimes as a direct source of counts of businesses by type, size, geography, economic activity, etc.\n\n\n\nAn entity that is capable, in its own right, of owning assets, incurring liabilities and engaging in economic activities and in transactions with other entities. There are two types of institutional units, namely legal entities and households.\n\n\n\nThis is an aggregation of institutional units on the basis of the type of producer and depending on their principal activity and function, which are considered to be indicative of their economic behaviour.

Although the national population register may be a virtual entity based on the linkage of population registers established at the local level (decentralized system), the overall geographical coverage must be of the entire territory of the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA complete enumeration of all economic establishments engaged in production and/or distribution of goods and services within a country or territory, at a specified point or period in time.\n\n\n\nA statistical operation for collecting, processing and disseminating data on the structure of agriculture, covering the whole or a significant part of the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA household survey is a method of data collection in which information is collected from a sample of households, usually using face-to-face interviews, postal questionnaires, or telephone interviews.\n\n\n\nA probability sampling method in which geographical areas are used as the primary sampling units, and samples are selected by first dividing the population into geographic units (such as blocks, villages, or enumeration areas) and then sampling within these areas.\n\n\n\nList sampling is a probability sampling method in which the sampling frame is a complete, up-to-date list of all units in the target population, and units are selected directly from this list using random or systematic methods.\n\n\n\nClustering means dividing the population into naturally occurring or practical groups (clusters) — like villages, city blocks, or schools.\n\n\n\nA sampling method in which the population is divided into clusters and a sample of these clusters is selected. Either all units within each selected cluster are observed or a sample of units within each cluster is selected.\n\n\n\nThe number of sampling units included in a single cluster in a cluster sampling design.\n\n\n\nA small area such as an EA in which a fixed number of households is selected and enumerated. Compact clusters are used to ensure that households are near each other, making fieldwork practical and economical\n\n\n\nA cluster in which the sampling units (e.g., households, dwellings, farms) are not physically concentrated in a small, contiguous area, but are instead spread out or dispersed over a wider geographical area.\n\n\n\nA survey sampling design that includes features such as stratification, clustering, multi-stage selection, or unequal selection probabilities to improve efficiency, precision, and feasibility compared to simple random sampling.\n\n\n\nThe degree of statistical confidence with which precision or margin of error around the survey estimate is obtained. The 95 per cent confidence level is generally regarded as the standard.\n\n\n\nA measure of efficiency of a complex sampling procedure compared to simple random sampling, defined as the ratio between the standard error using the given sample design and the standard error that would result if a simple random sample had been used.\n\n\n\nA sub-population for which separate estimation of the main indicators is required/or is to be provided.\n\n\n\nA rule or method of estimating a parameter of a population.

For example, the number of households in an EA.\n\n\n\nSample selection method in which the units are selected randomly with known and nonzero probabilities. This is the only way to obtain unbiased estimates and to be able to measure the precision of the survey indicators by estimating the sampling errors.\n\n\n\nSampling method in which the units are selected subjectively (non-random). Examples of non-probability sampling methods include: quota, judgmental, purposive, convenience, random walk sampling.\n\n\n\nErrors in estimates which arise from sources other than sampling variation. Examples include coverage errors, response errors, non-response errors, and processing errors.\n\n\n\nTheseare errors in the characteristics of persons counted, resulting from incorrect reporting or recording or from failure to report.\n\n\n\nThese are non-sampling errors that result from omitting a unit that should have been included, including a unit more than once, or including a unit that should not have been included.\n\n\n\nThe population that is actually covered by the sampling frame is called the survey population or sampled population.\n\n\n\nSubset of units, selected from a frame for the purpose of collecting information from those units. The inference about the population as a whole is drawn from the findings based on that sample.\n\n\n\nThe unit of selection at each stage of the sampling process, each unit being regarded as individual and indivisible when the selection is made.\n\n\n\nThe sampling unit for the first stage of selection in a multi-stage sampling procedure, typically a geographically defined unit such as an enumeration area (EA) or a segment of an EA.\n\n\n\nA unit selected in the second stage of a multi-stage sampling process.

This ensures that each unit represents the same number of units in the population, simplifying estimation and analysis by removing the need for unequal weighting adjustments.\n\n\n\nA sample in which each unit of the population has the same probability of inclusion and each possible sample of a given size has the same probability of being selected.\n\n\n\nA probability sampling method in which the population is divided into distinct subgroups, or strata, that are internally homogeneous with respect to certain characteristics but differ across strata. Independent samples are then drawn from each stratum according to specified allocation rules. This approach improves the precision of survey estimates and ensures adequate representation of key subpopulations.\n\n\n\nA procedure used in multi-stage sampling designs where a selected primary sampling unit (such as an enumeration area or village) is subdivided into smaller, approximately equal parts called segments. One or more segments are then randomly selected for listing. Segmentation ensures manageable fieldwork and maintains equal selection probabilities within large sampling units.\n\n\n\nA probability sampling method in which units are selected at regular intervals from an ordered sampling frame after the random selection of a starting point within the first interval.\n\n\n\nThe entire group of units about which survey information is required and to which the survey estimates are intended to apply. The target population should be clearly defined in terms of time, geography, and population characteristics to guide sampling design and ensure relevant, representative results.\n\n\n\nThe situation in which a selected unit in the sample, such as a household, individual, or establishment, does not provide any usable information for the survey. Unit non-response can arise due to refusal, absence, or inability to contact the unit.\n\n\n\nThe type of nonresponse in which some questions, but not all, are answered for a particular sampling unit.\n\n\n\nA field-based activity in which all households and dwellings within a selected area, such as an enumeration area or segment, are systematically identified and recorded to create an up-to-date sampling frame for selecting the final sample units for a household survey.\n\n\n\nThe number of respondents/units who complete a questionnaire divided the number of units in the sample, usually expressed as a percentage.\n\n\n\nThe number of respondents/units interviewed divided by the number eligible respondents/units for the survey.\n\n\n\nA measure expressing the extent to which the values of a variable differ from the mean of the variable.\n\n\n\nA type of survey that collects data on variables of interest at a single point in time, without following the same units over time. It provides a “snapshot” of the population’s characteristics, behaviours, or conditions at that specific time.\n\n\n\nA survey in which data is collected on the variables of interest from the same sample repeatedly over a period of time in order to study the changes over time.\n\n\n\nThe plan for selecting a sample from a population, including the definition of the sampling frame, the sample size, the sampling method, and the procedures for selecting the sample units.\n\n\n\nA structured plan outlining how a survey’s target population will be sampled and how data will be collected and processed to produce accurate, reliable, and representative official statistics.

The categories are defined in terms of one or more characteristics of a particular population of units of observation. A statistical classification may have a flat, linear structure or may be hierarchically structured, such that all categories at lower levels are sub-categories of a category at the next level up. The categories at each level of the classification structure must be mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive of all objects in the population of interest.\n\n\nA classification, which groups commodities according to their main end use.\n\n\n\nA classification based on the physical characteristics of goods or on the nature of the services rendered. Each type of good or service distinguished in the CPC is defined in such a way that it is normally produced by only one activity as defined in ISIC.

It classifies commodities based on criteria such as materials used, processing stage, market practices, and economic significance, making it particularly suitable for economic analysis and international trade comparisons. Unlike the HS, which is focused on the nature of the commodity for customs purposes, the SITC groups products by their stage of production to support analytical applications.\n\n\n\nThis is an international standard for recording, reporting, and monitoring diseases and health conditions. It provides a common language for health professionals worldwide and enables the systematic classification of diseases, disorders, injuries, and other health-related conditions.\n\n\n\nIt is a coherent and consistent classification structure of economic activities based on a set of internationally agreed concepts, definitions, principles and classification rules. It provides a comprehensive framework within which economic data can be collected and reported in a format that is designed for purposes of economic analysis, decision-taking and policy-making.\n\n\n\nThis is a domesticated version of the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC Rev. 4), modified to suit Kenya’s specific economic context. Notable changes include the introduction of 52 new classes, 973 sub-class 1 codes, and 1,180 sub-class 2 codes, which allow for a deeper disaggregation of economic activities unique to Kenya. It also includes categories to capture the informal and subsistence activities.\n\n\n\nThis is a classification of all the activities on which a person may spend time during the 24 hours that make up a day. Its purpose is to serve as a standard framework for time-use statistics based on activities grouped in a meaningful way.\n\n\n\nA system for classifying and aggregating jobs and occupations into groups according to the tasks and duties undertaken in the job. The system classifies persons according to their actual and potential relation with jobs. Jobs are classified with respect to the type of work performed or to be performed. The basic criteria used to define the system of major, sub-major, minor and unit groups is the ‘skill’ level and ‘skill specialisation’ required to carry out the tasks and duties of the occupations\n\n\n\nThis is a system used to categorize and classify jobs within the Kenyan labor market. It’s designed to standardize the way occupations are defined and organized, facilitating the collection and analysis of labor market information.

For example, the number of households in an EA.\n\n\n\nSample selection method in which the units are selected randomly with known and nonzero probabilities. This is the only way to obtain unbiased estimates and to be able to measure the precision of the survey indicators by estimating the sampling errors.\n\n\n\nSampling method in which the units are selected subjectively (non-random). Examples of non-probability sampling methods include: quota, judgmental, purposive, convenience, random walk sampling.\n\n\n\nErrors in estimates which arise from sources other than sampling variation. Examples include coverage errors, response errors, non-response errors, and processing errors.\n\n\n\nTheseare errors in the characteristics of persons counted, resulting from incorrect reporting or recording or from failure to report.\n\n\n\nThese are non-sampling errors that result from omitting a unit that should have been included, including a unit more than once, or including a unit that should not have been included.\n\n\n\nThe population that is actually covered by the sampling frame is called the survey population or sampled population.\n\n\n\nSubset of units, selected from a frame for the purpose of collecting information from those units. The inference about the population as a whole is drawn from the findings based on that sample.\n\n\n\nThe unit of selection at each stage of the sampling process, each unit being regarded as individual and indivisible when the selection is made.\n\n\n\nThe sampling unit for the first stage of selection in a multi-stage sampling procedure, typically a geographically defined unit such as an enumeration area (EA) or a segment of an EA.\n\n\n\nA unit selected in the second stage of a multi-stage sampling process. The SSU is chosen within each selected Primary Sampling Unit (PSU).\n\n\n\nThe number of ultimate units to be selected within each selected PSU.\n\n\n\nA sample in which the units are selected randomly with known and nonzero probabilities.\n\n\n\nA rapid, short-duration exercise to collect preliminary, indicative, or basic data such as measure of size.\n\n\n\nCloseness of the initial estimated value to the subsequent estimated value.\n\n\n\nA complete list of all sampling units that entirely covers the target population and is used as a basis for sampling.\n\n\n\nThe attributes of units of which the frame is composed, enabling the relevant population for the survey to be identified and stratified for sampling purposes, the sample to be selected, and the observation units to be identified and contacted for data.\n\n\n\nThe ratio of sample size to the total number of population size/units.\n\n\n\nThe number of sampling units selected or surveyed from the population.\n\n\n\nRandom error in survey estimate due to the fact that a sample rather than the entire population is surveyed; square root of sampling variance.\n\n\n\nThe standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic, or representative error due to sampling.\n\n\n\nThe amount of sampling error relative to the indicator level, independent of the scale of the indicator, calculated by dividing the standard error by the estimated value of the indicator.\n\n\n\nProcess of selecting sampling units in stages with units at each stage being sub-sampled from the (larger) units chosen at the previous stage.\n\n\n\nA sampling procedure in which the sample is selected in phases. In the first phase, a large sample is selected to obtain preliminary information, and in the second phase, a subsample of the initial sample is selected for more detailed information.\n\n\n\nThe basic weight assigned to each unit in the sample, equal to the inverse of its probability of selection according to the survey design.\n\n\n\nThe sampling weight (or survey weight) of a sampling unit is the design weight corrected for non-response or other calibrations like poststratification.\n\n\n\nA statistical adjustment method applied to survey weights after data collection to align the survey estimates with known population totals for certain key variables (like age, sex, or region).\n\n\n\nA sample is self-weighting if every sampling unit has the same selection probability and hence the same sampling weight.\n\n\n\nThe sampling variance of an estimate is the variance of the estimator over all possible samples that could be selected using the same sampling design.\n\n\n\nA sampling procedure in which the probability of selecting a sampling unit (such as an enumeration area, cluster, or establishment) is directly proportional to a known measure of its size (e.g., number of households, population, or employees), ensuring that each final element in the population has an equal chance of selection.\n\n\n\nA sample design in which every unit in the target population has an equal probability of selection, resulting in identical design weights for all sampled units. This ensures that each unit represents the same number of units in the population, simplifying estimation and analysis by removing the need for unequal weighting adjustments.\n\n\n\nA sample in which each unit of the population has the same probability of inclusion and each possible sample of a given size has the same probability of being selected.\n\n\n\nA probability sampling method in which the population is divided into distinct subgroups, or strata, that are internally homogeneous with respect to certain characteristics but differ across strata. Independent samples are then drawn from each stratum according to specified allocation rules. This approach improves the precision of survey estimates and ensures adequate representation of key subpopulations.\n\n\n\nA procedure used in multi-stage sampling designs where a selected primary sampling unit (such as an enumeration area or village) is subdivided into smaller, approximately equal parts called segments.
