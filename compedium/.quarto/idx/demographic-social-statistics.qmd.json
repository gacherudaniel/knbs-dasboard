{"title":"Demographic and social statistics","markdown":{"headingText":"Demographic and social statistics","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThis chapter covers statistical concepts and definitions related to population, vital events, health, education, labor, and social conditions. These statistics are fundamental for understanding demographic trends, social development, and human welfare indicators.\n\n## Population and migration\n\n### Population\n\nA collection of people or entities that share at least one characteristic (for example living in the same country at a particular time). Often however, multiple different 'populations' will be recorded in a census or survey, for instance the people living in households enumerated in the census, the students in schools surveyed or the patients at hospitals surveyed.\n\n### Population Census\n\nIt is a total process of planning, collecting, compiling, evaluating, analysing, publishing or otherwise disseminating demographic, social and economic data to all persons in a country or well-defined territory at a particular time.\n\n### Usual Resident\n\nAny person who has lived in his/her place of enumeration for six months or more or intends to live in that place for six months or more.\n\n### Present population\n\nPersons present and enumerated in the area.\n\n### De facto population\n\nIt comprises all persons physically present in the country, territory or geographic area to which the statistics refer at a specified time, regardless of legal residence status. This includes visitors from abroad, but excludes residents who are temporarily abroad.\n\n### De jure population\n\nComprises all persons for whom the geographic area in question is a place of usual residence at a specified time, regardless of whether they are present or absent from that area at the enumeration time. This includes residents who are temporarily abroad.\n\n### Population density\n\nNumber of people per unit area (square kilometres).\n\n### Population projection\n\nAn extrapolation of past demographic trends to predict some possible (or likely) future course of population.\n\n### Population growth rate\n\nThe percentage rate at which a population is increasing (or decreasing) in a given year owing to natural increase and net migration, expressed as a percentage of the base population.\n\n### Natural population increase\n\nThe difference between the number of live births and the number of deaths during the year. The natural increase rate is the natural increase divided by the average total population of the given area during a specified period. It is expressed as a percentage.\n\n### Population Pyramid\n\nA bar chart, arranged vertically, that shows the distribution of a population by age and sex. It is called a \"pyramid\" because typically each age group contains more people than the one above it, but other shapes are possible.\n\n### Migration\n\nMigration is defined as the movement of persons away from their place of usual residence, either across an international border (international migration) or within a State (internal migration).\n\n### International Migration\n\nThe movement of people from one country to another for the purpose of settlement.\n\n### Internal Migration\n\nThe movement of people from one area of a country to another area of the same country for the purpose of establishing a new residence.\n\n### In-migration\n\nThe process of people moving into a new area in their country to take up permanent or semi-permanent residence.\n\n### Out-migration\n\nThe process of people moving out of an area in their country to take up permanent or semi-permanent residence in another area of the same country.\n\n### Net migration\n\nThe difference between in-migration and out-migration for a particular area during a specific period. Net migration is positive when more people move into an area than move out, and negative when more people move out than move in.\n\n### Migrant\n\nA person who moves to a country other than that of his or her nationality or usual residence, so that the country of destination becomes his or her new country of usual residence.\n\n### Internal migrant\n\nAny person who changes his or her place of usual residence from one geographic unit to another within the borders of his/her country.\n\n### Immigrant\n\nA person who moves into a country from another country. The terms \"foreign-born\" and \"immigrant\" are used interchangeably and refer to people who were born outside of their country of residence, regardless of their current citizenship status.\n\n### Emigrant\n\nA person departing or moving out from a country to take up residence elsewhere.\n\n### Return migration\n\nThe movement of emigrants back to their countries of origin or usual residence.\n\n### Transit migration\n\nMovement of migrants through one or more countries to a country of destination.\n\n### Irregular migration\n\nIrregular migration involves the movement of persons outside the regulatory norms of sending, transit, and receiving countries. Migration is defined as irregular when migrants move without the necessary documentation or authorization to enter or reside in a country.\n\n### Place of birth\n\nThe geographic location where a person was born, usually expressed as a specific locality such as city or town, state, or country.\n\n### Country of birth\n\nCountry in which a person was born. If a person was born in a country that has subsequently changed its form of government or has changed its boundaries, the current name of the country (or countries) is used.\n\n### Citizenship\n\nThe particular legal bond between an individual and his or her State, acquired by birth or naturalization, whether by declaration, choice, marriage or other means according to national legislation.\n\n### Country of Citizenship\n\nThe country of which a person is a citizen.
