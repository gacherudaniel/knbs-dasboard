It assumes the conservation of natural assets for future growth and development.\n\n### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nAlso known as the Global Goals, they are an intergovernmental set of development goals which were adopted by the United Nations member states in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity.\n\n### Sustainable Development Goals, Targets and Indicators\n\nThe SDG includes 17 goals, 169 targets and 248 indicators. The goals set the aspiration of what the SDGs are trying to achieve. The 169 targets are the areas of change that need to be reached in order to achieve the 17 goals. Indicators are used to measure the progress on the target and goal.\n\n### Global SDG Indicator Framework\n\nA standardized set of 231 indicators adopted by the UN to monitor SDGs progress.      \n\n### Voluntary National Review (VNR)\n\nCountry-led assessments presented at the UN to report on SDGs implementation.\n\n### Data Revolution for Sustainable Development\n\nA global movement to improve data quality, timeliness, and inclusivity for better decisions.\n\n### SDG Dashboard\n\nA visual, interactive tool for tracking progress across the SDGs and indicators.      \n\n## Human Rights\n\nThe inalienable rights to which a person is entitled merely for being human. Human rights are built on underlying principles of universality, indivisibility, equality, participation, accountability and [non-discrimination](https://www.unhcr.org/glossary#non-discrimination), and are enshrined in international human rights law, rules of customary international law, national laws and other standards that define them and help to guarantee their full enjoyment.\n\nInherent claims to social arrangements that protect each and every person from abuses and deprivation that would prevent them from attaining their full potential.\n\n### Human Rights Mechanisms\n\nThe various human rights monitoring mechanisms of the United Nations system. These include UN Charter-based bodies (including the Human Rights Council, Universal Periodic Review and special procedures) and treaty-based bodies created under the international human rights treaties (known as treaty bodies).\n\n### Human Rights-Based Approach\n\nA conceptual framework underpinning human development and humanitarian action that is normatively based on international [human rights](https://www.unhcr.org/glossary#human-rights) standards and operationally directed to promoting and protecting human rights. A human rights-based approach identifies rights-holders and their entitlements and corresponding duty-bearers and their obligations, and works towards strengthening the capacities of rights-holders to make their claims and of duty-bearers to meet their obligations. It is not only about achieving human rights goals and outcomes, but also about achieving them through a participatory, inclusive, nondiscriminatory, transparent and responsive process.\n\n### International Bill of Human Rights\n\nDocuments that form the primary legal basis of United Nations activities to promote, protect and monitor [human rights](https://www.unhcr.org/glossary#human-rights) and fundamental freedoms. These include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(ICCPR).\n\n### Limitations on Human Rights\n\nLimitations placed by States on the exercise of certain [human rights](https://www.unhcr.org/glossary#human-rights) where they have valid reasons to do so, such as to protect the rights and freedoms of others, for national security, or to protect public health or morals. The burden falls upon States to prove that a limitation imposed upon the enjoyment of the right is legitimate.\n\n### Non-Derogable Rights\n\nThose human rights which cannot be subjected to limitations or suspensions under any conditions, including in times of public emergency. They include the right to life; the right not to be subjected to torture, or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; freedom from slavery and servitude; freedom of thought, conscience and religion. These rights are also known as peremptory norms of international law or jus cogens norms.\n\n### Non-Refoulement\n\nA core principle of international human rights and refugee law that prohibits States from returning individuals in any manner whatsoever (whether directly or indirectly) to territories where they may be at risk of persecution, torture, or other forms of serious or irreparable harm.\n\n### National Human Rights Institution (NHRI)\n\nA State institution established by Law or Constitution with a broad mandate to promote and protect human rights. NHRIs are independent institutions that function without interference from the State or any other stakeholders.\n\n### Conflict-Related Deaths\n\nThese are deaths for which there are reasonable grounds to believe that they resulted directly from acts of war and that the acts, decisions and/or purposes that caused these deaths were in furtherance of, or under the guise of armed conflict.\n\n### Journalists\n\nThese are individuals who observe, document, analyze and document events, statements, policies, and other developments that may impact society. Their primary role is to collect, verify, organize, and report  information in order to inform the public or specific sectors of society. This definition encompasses not only professional full-time reporters and analysts, but also media workers, support staff, community media practitioners, and citizen journalists who temporarily take on journalistic roles. It also includes bloggers and others who engage in self-publication through print, online platforms, or other media channels. Regardless of the medium or employment status, journalists share the common purpose of providing fact-based information and analysis to contribute to an informed society.\n\n### Trade Unionists\n\nIndividuals exercising their right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of their interests.\n\n### Trade Union\n\nAn association of workers organized to protect and promote their common interests.\n\n### Human Rights Defenders\n\nIndividuals who, alone or in association with others, exercise their rights to promote and strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at both national and international levels. This category may include certain journalists and trade unionists. While the term \"human rights advocate\" is often used synonymously, \"human rights defender\" is preferred as it aligns more closely with internationally agreed human rights standards and established practice.\n\n### Killing\n\nAny extrajudicial or unlawful execution carried out by State actors or by other actors with the State's permission, support, or acquiescence, motivated by the victim or someone associated with the victim engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender; or committed while the victim was undertaking such activities. This also includes killings by individuals or groups not supported by the State when the act was motivated by the victim's engagement in such activities and/or was met with a lack of due diligence by the State in responding to the harm, with such inaction motivated by the victim's or associate's role. It also includes unlawful attacks and destruction in violation of international humanitarian law that result in or are intended to cause the victim's death.\n\n### Enforced Disappearance\n\nThe arrest, detention, abduction, or any other form of deprivation of liberty of a person by State agents or by persons acting with the authorization, support, or acquiescence of the State, where such acts are motivated by the victim's or an associate's engagement in activities as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender. The act is followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the victim's fate or whereabouts, placing them outside the protection of the law.\n\n### Torture\n\nAny act whereby severe physical or mental pain or suffering is intentionally inflicted on a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender for purposes such as obtaining information or a confession, punishing, intimidating, coercing them, or for reasons based on discrimination of any kind. This applies when the pain or suffering is inflicted by, or with the consent, instigation, or acquiescence of, a public official or someone acting in an official capacity.\n\n### Arbitrary Detention\n\nThe arrest or detention of a person that is not in accordance with national laws either because it lacks a legal basis or does not follow established legal procedures and is motivated by the victim's or an associate's engagement in activities as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender. It is considered arbitrary when it is inappropriate, unjust, unreasonable, or unnecessary under the circumstances.\n\n### Kidnapping\n\nThe unlawful detention, abduction, or confinement of a person without their consent by individuals or groups not acting with the State's support or acquiescence, where the State fails to exercise due diligence in responding to the incident. Such failure is motivated by the victim's or an associate's engagement in activities as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender.\n\n### Other Harmful Acts\n\nOther actions by State actors or by individuals acting with the State's permission, support, or acquiescence that cause or intend to cause harm, and that are motivated by the victim's role as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender.\n\n### Verified Cases\n\nReported cases that include a minimum set of relevant information about the individuals and circumstances involved, and have been reviewed by mandated bodies or mechanisms, which found reasonable grounds to believe that the individuals were victims of human rights violations or abuses.\n\n### Discrimination\n\nAny distinction, exclusion, restriction, or preference either direct or indirect based on prohibited grounds, with the intent or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment, or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis in the political, economic, social, cultural, or other public spheres.\n\n### Harassment\n\nA form of discrimination based on prohibited grounds, which may involve words, gestures, or actions that annoy, alarm, demean, intimidate, belittle, humiliate, or embarrass another person, or create a hostile or offensive environment. While often involving repeated behavior, harassment may also occur as a single incident.\n\n### Agent of Persecution\n\nPeople or entities responsible for acts or threats of persecution. These may include State Authorities or non-State actors.\n\n### Detention\n\nThe deprivation of liberty or confinement in a closed place from which an asylum-seeker cannot leave at will, including prisons or designated detention, reception, or holding centers.\n\n### Alternatives to Detention\n\nLegislation, policies, or practices that allow asylum-seekers to reside in the community under certain conditions or restrictions on movement while their protection claims are processed.\n\n### Asylum Seeker\n\nA general term for a person seeking international protection. In some countries, it has a legal meaning, referring to an individual who has applied for refugee or complementary protection status and is awaiting a final decision. It may also refer to individuals who intend to apply or who may be in need of such protection.\n\n### Displacement\n\nThe forced or compelled movement of individuals from their homes or habitual places of residence either within their country or across borders due to armed conflict, generalized violence, human rights violations, or natural or human-made disasters.\n\n### Forced Marriage\n\nA marriage in which one or both parties have not given their full and free consent. Child marriage is considered a form of forced marriage and constitutes a violation of human rights.\n\n### Freedom of Movement\n\nA fundamental human right comprising the freedom to move within a country, the right to leave any country, and the right to return to one's own country.\n\n### Protection\n\nAll activities aimed at ensuring full respect for the rights of individuals in line with the principles and provisions of international human rights, refugee, and humanitarian law.\n\n### Self Reliance\n\nThe ability of an individual, household or community to meet essential needs and to enjoy social and economic rights in a sustainable manner and with dignity.\n\n## Gender Statistics\n\nGender statistics refer to statistics that adequately reflect differences and inequalities between women and men in all areas of life. Gender statistics are more than just statistics about women or sex-disaggregated data. They include:\n\n·       Sex-disaggregated data;\n\n·       Data pertaining specifically to women or men;\n\n·       Data capturing gender issues, even if they do not explicitly mention gender, sex, or women and men.\n\n### Gender\n\nGender is a socio-cultural construct that defines and determines the roles, responsibilities, entitlements, and limitations of women, men, girls, and boys in society. It influences their societal position and varies across time, space, and context. Gender refers to the roles and expectations assigned by society, not biology.\n\n### Sex\n\nSex refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that distinguish females and males. These characteristics are natural, unlike gender, which is socially constructed and shaped by historical, cultural, and relational contexts.\n\n### Gender Analysis\n\nGender analysis examines how differences in roles, responsibilities, needs, opportunities, and rights affect women, men, girls, and boys. It analyzes their constraints and the impacts of these differences to inform policies and programs. This analysis highlights gender gaps and supports equitable development planning.\n\n### Gender Relations\n\nThese are socially constructed relationships between women and men in a given cultural context. They differ from biological distinctions and influence power dynamics, access to resources, and social positioning.\n\n### Gender Issues\n\nGender issues refer to challenges, opportunities, and barriers affecting both women and men, girls and boys. They are not synonymous with women's issues.\n\n### Gender-Aware Planning\n\nThis is the process of incorporating gender considerations into planning and development initiatives. It acknowledges that programs affect women/girls and men/boys differently. The use of sex-disaggregated data is essential in policymaking, planning, budgeting, and decision-making.\n\n### Gender Inequality\n\nGender inequality refers to unequal access to resources, opportunities, and benefits for women and men. It hinders individual development, national growth, and societal progress.\n\n### Gender Statistics\n\nGender statistics reflect the socio-cultural realities of women, men, girls, and boys. They include sex-disaggregated data and other statistics relevant to gender-related issues.\n\n### Sex-Disaggregated Data\n\nData categorized separately for males and females. This disaggregation is essential for identifying inequalities and conducting effective gender analysis.\n\n### Gender-Disaggregated Data\n\nData that are broken down by sex and other variables such as age, location, ethnicity, disability, socio-economic status, and education. These distinctions help reveal hidden inequalities.\n\n### Statistics on Women\n\nData focused exclusively on women, often used to highlight their situation. However, they do not allow for comparisons with men and cannot fully reveal gender gaps.\n\n### Gender Bias\n\nBias arising from decisions or assumptions based on gender, often favoring men or boys over women or girls.\n\n### Gender Stereotyping\n\nAssigning specific attributes, characteristics, or roles to individuals solely based on their gender. Stereotyping becomes harmful when it limits opportunities or choices, particularly in education, careers, or personal development.\n\n### Gender Equality\n\nThe condition in which women and men, girls and boys have equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities. Gender equality ensures that individuals can realize their full potential without discrimination based on gender.\n\n### Gender Indicators\n\nMeasures used to assess progress toward gender equality. These may be quantitative (e.g., statistics, figures) or qualitative (e.g., perceptions, experiences).\n\n### Gender Equity\n\nThe principle of fairness in treatment for women and men, accounting for different needs, interests, and experiences. It may require special measures to address historic or systemic disadvantages.\n\n### Gender Gap\n\nThe measurable difference between women and men in terms of access to opportunities, resources, and participation in various sectors.\n\n### Gender Disparities\n\nStatistical differences, often called gaps, between men and women that reflect unequal conditions or outcomes.\n\n### Gender Parity\n\nGender parity is a numerical measure that reflects relative equality in terms of the number and proportion of women and men, or girls and boys. It is commonly calculated as the ratio of female to male values for a given indicator. When the ratio is calculated as male to female instead, the term \"sex ratio\" is used rather than \"gender parity.\"\n\n### Gender Parity Index\n\nThe Gender Parity Index (GPI) measures the relative access to education of female and male students. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of females to the number of males enrolled at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of education.\n\n### Gender Development Index (GDI)\n\nThe GDI is a tool used to measure gender inequalities in the social, cultural, economic, and political spheres. It assesses gender gaps in human development across three key dimensions:\n\n1.       Health – measured by female and male life expectancy at birth;\n\n2.     Education – measured by female and male expected years of schooling for children and mean years of schooling for adults aged 25 and above;\n\n3.      Economic resources – measured by estimated earned income for females and males.\n\n### Gender Blindness\n\nGender blindness refers to the failure to recognize that the roles and responsibilities of women/girls and men/boys are socially and culturally constructed. Gender-blind studies, programs, projects, policies, and attitudes maintain the status quo, overlooking diverse needs and roles, and therefore fail to transform unequal gender relations.\n\n### Gender Roles\n\nGender roles are social and behavioral norms that a given culture considers appropriate for individuals of a specific sex. These roles often determine traditional tasks and responsibilities assigned to women, men, boys, and girls, and are shaped by factors such as household structure, access to resources, the global economy, conflict, disasters, and local ecological conditions.\n\n### Gender Norms\n\nGender norms are the accepted attributes and behaviors associated with male and female identities in a specific society or community at a particular point in time. They establish standards and expectations of how men and women should act. Internalized early in life, gender norms influence lifelong gender socialization and stereotypes.\n\n### Gender Planning\n\nGender planning is an approach that acknowledges the different roles of women and men in society and recognizes that their needs often differ.\n\n### Strategic Gender Needs\n\nThese are the requirements necessary for women and men to improve their status or position in society. Addressing strategic gender needs enables individuals to move beyond restrictive social roles. For women, these needs may include land rights, decision-making power, equal pay, and access to credit.\n\n### Gender Relations\n\nGender relations are a specific subset of social relations that define interactions between men and women as social groups. These relations intersect with other social influences—such as age, ethnicity, race, and religion—to shape individuals' status and identity. As social constructs, gender relations can be changed.\n\n### Gender Balance\n\nGender balance refers to equal participation of women and men in all areas of work and within programs initiated or supported by institutions. Achieving gender balance creates a more inclusive environment, enhances policy and program effectiveness, and strengthens institutional capacity to serve the entire population.\n\n### Gender Accommodating\n\nIt's the awareness of gender differences and the willingness to adjust and adapt policies, programs, or actions accordingly. It is closely related to gender sensitivity.\n\n### Gender Perspective\n\nTaking a gender perspective involves considering gender-based differences in any social phenomenon, policy, or process. It emphasizes differences in status and power and examines how gender-based discrimination shapes both immediate needs and long-term interests. In policymaking, a gender perspective ensures that women's and men's experiences are equally considered in the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of programs and policies.\n\n### Gender Mainstreaming\n\nGender mainstreaming is the systematic integration of a gender perspective into the preparation, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of policies, regulations, and spending programs, with the aim of promoting gender equality and eliminating discrimination.\n\n### Gender Mainstreaming in Statistics\n\nThis involves the systematic consideration of gender issues and the elimination of gender-based bias throughout all stages of statistical production.\n\n### Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)\n\nAll procedures involving the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.\n\n### Domestic Violence\n\nAll acts of physical, sexual, psychological, or economic violence occurring within the family or domestic setting. This applies regardless of biological or legal ties and includes violence between current or former spouses or partners, whether or not they share a residence.\n\n### Gender-Based Violence (GBV)\n\nAn umbrella term for any harmful act perpetrated against a person based on socially ascribed gender differences. GBV varies across cultures and regions and includes sexual violence, domestic violence, trafficking, forced or early marriage, harmful traditional practices (e.g., FGM, honor killings, widow inheritance), and more. These acts may occur in both public and private settings.\n\n### Women's Issues\n\nThese refer to the unique opportunities, challenges, and constraints that affect women and girls. Due to inadequate representation at decision-making levels, their needs are often overlooked or inadequately addressed.\n\n### Women in Development (WID)\n\nThe WID approach highlights the marginalization of women in development processes. It advocates for the inclusion of women in development initiatives to ensure that they benefit equally from resources and interventions.\n\n### Empowerment\n\nRefers to enhancing the personal, political, social, or economic strength of individuals and communities. Women's empowerment enables them to gain control over their lives through increased awareness, confidence, choice, access to resources, and transformation of discriminatory structures and institutions.\n\n### Women's Economic Empowerment\n\nRefers to enabling women to participate equally in and benefit from decent work, social protection, market access, and control over resources, time, and decision-making. It also involves increasing women's voice, agency, and participation in economic decisions at all levels, from the household to international institutions.\n\n## Special Population Groups\n\n### Person with Disability\n\nA person with a disability is someone who has a long-term physical, psychological, intellectual, or sensory impairment which, in interaction with various barriers, may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.\n\n### Disability Cash Benefits\n\nDisability cash benefits refer to financial payments made to individuals who are fully or partially unable to engage in gainful employment due to a disability. The disability may be congenital or acquired as a result of an accident or illness during the individual's lifetime. These benefits do not include those resulting from prescribed industrial accidents or occupational diseases, which are classified under occupational injury and disease. The provision of goods and services in kind is categorized under services for the elderly and persons with disabilities.\n\n### Stateless Persons\n\nStateless persons are individuals who are not recognized as nationals by any state under the operation of its laws; either because they never acquired a nationality or because they lost it without obtaining a new one.\n\n### Stateless Population, *In Situ*\n\nThis refers to stateless individuals who have never crossed an international border but remain in their \"own country\"- a place where they have long-standing and significant ties, usually through birth or long-term residence. Their statelessness is often the result of shortcomings in the design or implementation of nationality laws.\n\n### Indigenous Peoples\n\nIndigenous peoples are communities, groups, or individuals who are descended from the original inhabitants of a country or region, and who retain distinct social, cultural, economic, and political characteristics. They often maintain their own languages, traditions, customs, and institutions and have a strong connection to ancestral lands and natural resources. Indigenous peoples typically identify themselves as such and are recognized by others as belonging to distinct cultural groups. Despite their diversity, they frequently face challenges related to marginalization, land rights, and preservation of cultural heritage.\n\n### Guardian\n\nA guardian is an independent adult who safeguards a child's best interests and general well-being and complements the child's limited legal capacity.\n\n### Unaccompanied Child\n\nAn unaccompanied child is one who has been separated from both parents and other relatives and is not being cared for by an adult who, by law or custom, is responsible for doing so.\n\n### Alternative Care (Child Protection)\n\nAlternative care refers to arrangements made for children who are temporarily or permanently deprived of their family environment or whose best interests require placement outside their family.\n\n### Best Interests of the Child Principle\n\nAs stated in Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC): \"In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.\"\n\n### Justice for Children\n\nJustice for children refers to a United Nations framework and set of guiding principles aimed at ensuring that justice systems better serve and protect children. It promotes full adherence to international norms and standards for all children who come into contact with justice or related systems, whether as victims, witnesses, alleged offenders, or for matters involving care, custody, or protection.\n\n### Juvenile Justice\n\nJuvenile justice is a justice system designed specifically for children or young persons who are considered juveniles under the respective legal system. It ensures that offenses committed by juveniles are addressed in a manner distinct from how adult offenses are treated. Age limits defining juveniles vary by country.\n\n### Older Person\n\nAccording to the United Nations, an older person is someone aged 60 years or older. However, in many communities, age is also determined by socio-cultural markers such as family status (e.g., being a grandparent), physical appearance (e.g., grey hair, wrinkles), or age-related health conditions.\n\n### Youth\n\nThere is no universally agreed international definition of \"youth.\" For statistical purposes, however, the United Nations defines youth as individuals between the ages of 15 and 24 years, without prejudice to definitions adopted by individual Member States.\n\n### Person of Concern\n\nThis term traditionally refers to all individuals for whom the UNHCR is mandated to provide protection, assistance, and durable solutions. It includes refugees, asylum-seekers, refugee returnees, stateless persons, and—in many situations—internally displaced persons (IDPs), including those supported by State and non-State partners.\n\n## Living Conditions and Poverty\n\nLiving conditions are the circumstances or factors affecting the way in which people live, particularly with regard to their well-being. The term 'living conditions' is closely related to that of 'quality of life.\n\nPoverty is a state or condition in which an individual lacks the financial resources and essentials for a basic standard of living.\n\n### Welfare Analysis\n\nWelfare analysis, in economics, is the study of how policies or market changes affect the well-being of individuals and society, primarily by measuring the net benefits to consumers and producers.\n\n### Poverty\n\nPoverty is a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, such as food, clean water, shelter, education, and healthcare (monetary and non-monetary). It typically results from a lack of access to resources or opportunities to improve one's economic situation. Poverty is often measured by income levels, with individuals or households falling below a certain income threshold considered to be in poverty. However, poverty also encompasses other dimensions, including social exclusion, lack of access to essential services, and limited opportunities for economic and social advancement.\n\n### Household Expenditure\n\nHousehold expenditure refers to the total spending by a person living alone or a group of people living together on goods and services within a specific time period.\n\n### Household Consumption\n\nHousehold consumption is the quantity of goods and services that the household enjoys in a given period.\n\n### Household Consumption Expenditure\n\nHousehold consumption expenditure includes those money outlays directed toward consumption (e.g., it excludes outlays for investment purposes).\n\n### Data Used in Analysis\n\nData used in analysis refers to the specific information, collected and prepared, that is subjected to various techniques and methods to extract meaningful insights, support decision-making, and draw conclusions. It encompasses raw data that has been organized, cleaned, and potentially transformed to make it suitable for analysis.\n\n### Recall Period\n\nThe recall period in an interview refers to the specific timeframe that respondents are asked to remember or reflect upon when providing information. It is a key aspect in survey design, especially in interviews related to data collection on behaviors, expenditures, or experiences.\n\nIn an interview about household income, the recall period might be \"the last month\" or \"the past year,\" and respondents would be asked to report their income or expenditures during that specific period. The choice of recall period is important because it affects the accuracy and reliability of the responses. If the recall period is too long, respondents may forget details or provide inaccurate information. If it is too short, the information might not capture enough relevant data to make meaningful conclusions.\n\n### -Day Recall Period\n\nRecall interviews with a 7-day recall period are used for the collection of food consumption data, as this method provides a good balance between accuracy and cost-effectiveness.\n\n### 1-Month Recall Period\n\nRecall interviews with a 1-month recall period are used for the collection of frequent non-food consumption data.\n\n### 6-Month Recall Period\n\nRecall interviews with a 6-month recall period are used for the collection of less frequent non-food consumption data.\n\n### 1-Year Recall Period\n\nRecall interviews with a 1-year recall period are used for the collection of durable goods consumption data.\n\n### Nominal Consumption Aggregate (NCA)\n\nThe computation of a consumption-based welfare measure consists of assembling the so-called nominal consumption aggregate (NCA) from survey data. NCA is defined as the value of all goods and services consumed by members of the household during the reference period (see Household Consumption Expenditure).\n\n### Modes of Acquisition\n\nAll surveys should collect data on all main modes of food acquisition, namely:\\\n a) Purchases;\\\n b) Household's own production; and\\\n c) Received in kind/gifts, etc.\n\n### Household's Own Production\n\nFood from own production includes products usually sold as part of a household's main commercial enterprise that are instead reserved for consumption (farm households are a typical example), as well as non-commercial and subsistence food production, and food acquired from hunting, fishing, and gathering.\n\n### Food Received in Kind\n\nFood received in kind in the form of transfers from other households, the private sector, or the government.\n\n### Food Away from Home\n\n\"Food away from home\" generally refers to food prepared away from home, regardless of whether the food is consumed outside or inside the home. This includes meals and snacks purchased from restaurants and other commercial establishments (including takeout meals), received in-kind at school, at work, from other households, etc.\n\n### Non-Food Non-Durable Items\n\nThe non-food non-durable items of the non-food component of the NCA will include all the items in Division 03 \"Clothing and Footwear\" through to Category 13 \"Personal Care, Social Protection, and Miscellaneous Goods,\" referencing the Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP), the international reference classification of household expenditures (United Nations, 2018).\n\n### Durable Goods (Items)\n\nThe durable goods/items of the non-food component of the NCA include those defined by their durability—meaning their ability to deliver useful services through repeated use over an extended period. Examples include automobiles, household appliances, and electronic devices.\n\n### Hedonic Rent Imputation – Housing Component of the NCA\n\nHedonic rent imputation is a method used in economic analysis to estimate the value of housing or real estate, accounting for attributes that influence price, such as location, size, amenities, and condition. The \"hedonic pricing model\" assumes the price of a good (in this case, housing) is determined by the sum of the values of its individual characteristics.\n\n### Adjusting for Price Variation\n\nAdjusting for price variation refers to accounting for differences in prices over time or across locations when comparing economic data, such as income, expenditure, or living standards. This adjustment—using either Paasche or Laspeyres price deflators—eliminates the influence of price changes or regional disparities to enable like-for-like comparisons.\n\n### Adjusting for Household Size and Composition\n\nThis refers to modifying economic indicators (such as income or expenditure) to account for differences in the number and characteristics of household members (e.g., age, gender) using equivalence scales or consumption needs.\n\n### Poverty Profile\n\nA description of how the extent of poverty varies across sub-groups of a given population, characterized by gender, geographical location, type of economic activity, income source, etc.\n\n### Poverty Line\n\nThe poverty line is a monetary threshold determined at a specific time and location, representing the minimum level of income or consumption expenditure required to meet basic needs, including food, housing, clothing, and healthcare.\n\n### The Food Poverty Line\n\nThe food poverty line represents the minimum monetary threshold in Kenyan Shillings required to meet nutritional needs based on consumption patterns. It is calculated based on food that provides 2,250 Kcal per adult equivalent per day, over a 30-day period.\n\n### Absolute Poverty/Overall Poverty Line\n\nThe monetary threshold in Kenyan Shillings required to purchase a combination of food and non-food items per adult equivalent per month.\n\n### Food Poverty\n\nIndividuals (or households, if estimated at the household level) whose food consumption per adult equivalent falls below the food poverty line in rural or urban areas are considered food poor or in \"food poverty.\"\n\n### Overall (Absolute) Poverty\n\nIndividuals (or households) whose total (food and non-food) consumption per adult equivalent falls below the overall poverty line are considered in \"overall poverty.\"\n\n### Hardcore (Extreme) Poverty\n\nIndividuals (or households) whose total consumption per adult equivalent is below the food poverty line are considered in \"hardcore poverty.\"\n\n### The Headcount Ratio (HCR or P~0~)/Headcount Ratio (H)\n\nThe proportion of individuals (or households) whose total consumption falls below the poverty line. It is the most commonly used measure of poverty due to its simplicity and ease of interpretation.\n\n### Poverty Gap (P~1~)\n\nThe poverty gap index measures the average shortfall from the poverty line as a percentage. It reflects the mean distance of the poor from the poverty line, with those above the line considered to have zero shortfall. It also indicates the minimum cost to eliminate poverty under perfect targeting.\n\n### Squared Poverty Gap/Severity of Poverty\n\nThis index squares each poverty gap before averaging, placing greater weight on the poorest. It accounts for inequality among the poor. Proposed by Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (1984), it is part of a class of poverty measures varying the weight of deprivation severity.\n\n### The Gini Index\n\nThe Gini coefficient measures inequality in consumption expenditure. A value of 0 indicates perfect equality, while a value of 100 indicates maximum inequality (i.e., one individual has all the expenditure).\n\n### Multidimensional Poverty\n\nA measure of poverty that considers factors beyond income, such as education, health, and living standards.\n\n## Climate Change\n\nClimate change refers to any significant change in the measures of climate lasting for an extended period of time. In other words, climate change includes major changes in temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns, among others, that occur over several decades or longer. It is attributed directly or indirectly to human (anthropogenic) activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere. The term is frequently used in reference to global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activities.\n\n### Climate\n\nRefers to the condition of the atmosphere at a particular location (microclimate) or region over a long period of time. It is the long-term summation of atmospheric elements – such as solar radiation, temperature, humidity, precipitation type (frequency and amount), atmospheric pressure, and wind (speed and direction) – and their variations.\n\n### Weather\n\nWeather is the state of the atmosphere of a given place at a given time. The elements of weather include, but are not limited to, rainfall, temperature, pressure, wind, cloud cover, and humidity.\n\n### Environment\n\nThe totality of all the external conditions (physical, biological, and socio-economic) affecting the life, development, and survival of an organism.\n\n### Climate Model\n\nA numerical representation of the climate system based on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of its components, their interactions, and feedback processes, and accounting for some of its known properties. The climate system can be represented by models of varying complexity; that is, for any one component or combination of components, a spectrum or hierarchy of models can be identified, differing in such aspects as the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to which physical, chemical, or biological processes are explicitly represented, or the level at which empirical parametrizations are involved.\n\n### Climate Prediction\n\nA probabilistic statement about future climate conditions on timescales ranging from seasons to decades. It is based on conditions known at present and assumptions about the physical processes that will determine future changes. When a projection is branded \"most likely,\" it becomes a prediction, and outputs of which can enable some level of confidence to be attached to projections.\n\n### Climate Projection\n\nThe simulated response of the climate system to a scenario of future emissions or concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols, generally derived using climate models. Projections provide a potential future evolution of a quantity or set of quantities, often computed with the aid of a model. Climate projections are distinguished from climate predictions by their dependence on the emission/concentration/radiative forcing scenario used, which is, in turn, based on assumptions concerning, for example, future socio-economic and technological developments that may or may not be realized. Unlike predictions, projections are conditional on assumptions concerning such future developments.\n\n### Climate-Resilient Pathways\n\nThe iterative processes for managing change within complex systems in order to reduce disruptions and enhance opportunities associated with climate change.\n\n### Climate Risk\n\nThe potential for consequences from climate variability and change where something of value is at stake and the outcome is uncertain. Often represented as the probability that a hazardous event or trend occurs multiplied by the expected impact. Risk results from the interaction of vulnerability, exposure, and hazard.\n\n### Climate Variability\n\nVariations in the mean state and other statistics (e.g., standard deviations, occurrence of extremes) of the climate across all spatial and temporal scales beyond that of individual weather events. Variability may be due to natural internal processes within the climate system (internal variability), or to variations in natural or anthropogenic external forcing (external variability).\n\n### Air Pollutants\n\nAir pollutants are substances in air that could, at high enough concentrations, harm human beings, animals, vegetation, or material. Air pollutants may consist of solid particles, liquid droplets, gases, or combinations of these forms.\n\n### Air Pollution\n\nAir pollution is the presence of contaminant or pollutant substances in the air that do not disperse properly and interfere with human health or welfare, or produce other harmful environmental effects.\n\n### Air Pollution Control\n\nAir pollution control refers to steps taken to maintain a standard of air purity for good public health, protection of plant and animal life and property, visibility, and safe ground and air transportation.\n\n### Air Pollution Index (API)\n\nAn air pollution index (API) is a quantitative measure that describes ambient air quality.

When the precision of the direct estimate is not adequate, oversampling within the domain or applying statistical techniques that allow reliable estimates in the domain may be necessary.\n\n### Population of Interest\n\nThe population for which the survey is designed, for example, households or persons living in a specific county or region.\n\n### Unit of Analysis\n\nRefers to the level at which a measurement is taken—for example, persons, households, farms, or establishments.\n\n### Variable of Interest / Target Variable / Dependent Variable\n\nThe information of interest to be captured by the survey, for example, consumption expenditure.\n\n### Auxiliary Variables / Auxiliary Information / Covariate\n\nVariables that affect the variables of interest, for example, age, education, sex, religion, etc.\n\n### Domain / Area\n\nA domain or area is defined as the subdivision for which estimations are desired. These can be planned domains (e.g., counties) or unplanned designs (e.g., sub-counties). \"Areas\" can be geographic or socio-economic delimitations or the result of cross-tabulating the two. Examples include geographic areas (state, county, school district, health service area), socio-demographic groups, or both (e.g., a specific age-sex-race group within a large geographic area), or other subpopulations (e.g., a set of firms belonging to a census division by industry group).\n\n### Small Area Estimation\n\nSmall area estimation is a set of methods used to achieve estimates of acceptable quality for publication. As statistical information is disaggregated into smaller population subgroups, it becomes noisier and yields larger coefficients of variation (CV), which may exceed the threshold established by the National Statistical Offices (NSO), above which they may choose not to publish that specific estimate.\n\n### Model-Based Small Area Estimates\n\nModel-based small area estimates rely on statistical models to establish a relationship between a dependent variable and a set of covariates. The covariates and parameters obtained from the fitted model are then used to predict the dependent variable in the auxiliary data. In the context of small area estimates of poverty under unit-level models, the dependent variable is typically consumption, expenditure, or income, and the method relies on properly replicating the welfare distribution.\n\n### Area-Level Models\n\nIn small area estimation methodologies, area-level models use only aggregate auxiliary information at the area level. Aggregated data are more readily available because they are typically not subject to confidentiality restrictions.\n\n### Unit-Level Models\n\nUnit-level models refer to models where detailed unit-record data are available—for example, detailed income/expenditure information from household surveys and a set of household-level characteristics available in both a household survey and a population census—to simulate household expenditures or incomes for each household in the population census data.\n\n## Information Society and Digitalization\n\n### Airtime Charges\n\nCharges to users of wireless networks based on a flat rate or on the actual time used.
