It includes aspects such as air, water, soil quality, and the natural habitats that support ecosystems and human activities.\n\n### Weather\n\nWeather is the state of the atmosphere of a given place at a given time. The elements of weather include, but are not limited to, rainfall, temperature, pressure, wind, cloud cover and humidity.\n\n### Climate\n\nClimate is the average weather pattern in a place over a period of at least thirty years as defined by the World Meteorological Organization\n\n### Climate change\n\nClimate change is a permanent shift in the state of climate that persists for an extended period (decades or longer).

The biological sludge can then be used for soil improvement. The amount of waste that can be treated with biological means for other useful purposes\n\n### Greenhouse Gas Emission\n\nIt is the emission of those gases that, by affecting the radiation transfer through the atmosphere, contribute to the greenhouse effect.\n\n### Emission\n\nDischarge of substances, heat, and sound into the atmosphere, water and soil from sources such as smokestacks, vents, surface areas of commercial or industrial facilities etc.\n\n### Waste\n\nAny material (solid, liquid, or gaseous) discharged into the environment without immediate use.\n\n### Solid Waste\n\nAny useless and sometimes hazardous material with low liquid content. Solid wastes include municipal garbage, industrial and commercial waste, sewage sludge, wastes resulting from agricultural and animal husbandry operations and other connected activities, demolition wastes and mining residues.\n\n### Biological Waste\n\nWaste containing natural organic materials (remains of plants, animal excreta, biological sludge from waste-water treatment, plants, etc) and capable of undergoing biological degradation.\n\n### Agricultural Waste\n\nAny waste produced as a result of various agricultural operations. It includes manure and other wastes from farms, poultry houses and slaughter-house, harvest waste, fertilizer run-offs from fields, pesticides that enter into water, air or soils, etc.\n\n### Industrial Waste\n\nLiquid, solid and gaseous wastes originating from the manufacture of specific products.\n\n### Water Pollution\n\nThe presence in water of harmful and objectionable materials (obtained mainly from sewers, industrial wastes, and rainwater run-offs) and in sufficient concentrations to make the water unfit for use.\n\n## Hazardous events and disasters\n\nHazardous events and disasters refer to natural or human-induced occurrences that significantly disrupt the environment, cause loss of life or property, and negatively impact ecosystems, communities, and economies. These events are often classified based on their origin (natural or anthropogenic) and can vary in scale, frequency, and severity.\n\n### Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ)\n\nThis is a belt of low pressure which circles the Earth generally near the equator where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres come together. It is characterized by convective activity which generates often vigorous thunderstorms over large areas\n\n## Human Settlements and Environmental Health\n\nThis sub-domain focuses on the interaction between human settlements (such as urban, suburban, and rural areas) and environmental factors that influence public health. It includes aspects like housing, sanitation, water supply, waste management, and the overall livability of human environments, as well as the environmental determinants of health.\n\n### Environmental Sanitation\n\nImprovement of conditions in households that affect human health by means of drainage and disposal of sewage, human excreta, and refuse.\n\n### Safe Drinking Water\n\nClean water supplied from an improved water source, such as a borehole/shallow well fitted with a hand pump, or a protected spring or gravity flow scheme, or treated piped water, subject to maintenance of a safe drinking-water chain.\n\n### Sanitation\n\nEncompasses the isolation/management of excreta from the environment, maintenance of personal, domestic and food hygiene, safe disposal of solid and liquid wastes, maintaining a safe drinking-water chain and vector control.\n\n### Population using basic drinking water service\n\nPopulation using an improved drinking water source/facility with a total collection time of 30 minutes or less for a round-trip, including queuing\n\n### Population using safely managed drinking water services\n\nPopulation using an improved source of drinking water (improved source of drinking water include: Piped water into dwelling yard or plot, borehole or tube wells, protected dug wells, protected spring, rainwater and packaged or delivered water) which is located on premises, available when needed and free of (faecal and priority chemical) contamination.\n\n### Population using basic sanitation services\n\nPopulation using an improved sanitation facility (improved Sanitation facilities include: flush/pour flush to piped sewer system, septic tank or latrine; ventilated improved pit latrine, composting toilet or pit latrine with slab) which is not shared with households\n\n### Population using safely managed sanitation services\n\nPopulation using improved sanitation facilities (improved sanitation facilities include: flush or pour flush to piped sewer systems; septic tanks or pit latrine; ventilated improved pit latrine; composting toilet or pit latrine with slab) which is not shared with other households and where excreta are treated and disposed in situ or transported and treated offsite\n\n## Environmental protection, Management and Engagement\n\nThis sub-domain focuses on activities, policies, and measures designed to preserve, manage, and improve the quality of the environment.
