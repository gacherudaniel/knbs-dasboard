There are two major categories of abortion: spontaneous and induced. Induced abortions are those initiated by deliberate action undertaken with the intention of terminating pregnancy; all other abortions are considered spontaneous.\n\n### Adoption\n\nAdoption is the legal and voluntary taking and treating of the child of other parents as one's own in so far as provided by the laws of the country. By means of a judicial process, whether related or not to the adopter, the adopted child acquires the rights and status of a legitimate child.\n\n### Age dependency ratio\n\nAgedependency ratios give the number of economically inactive people in relation to each economically active person. Classifications of economically active and inactive are usually made on the basis of age, with everyone aged less than 15 and everyone aged 65 and over considered economically inactive. The overall dependency ratio can be broken down into constituent parts, giving the child dependency ratio (number of children in relation to each economically active person) and the old-age dependency ratio (number of people aged 65 and over in relation to each economically active person).\n\n### Age misreporting\n\nThis is the misreporting/mistating of a person's age by giving a value which is less or more than actual, either intentionally or unintentionally.\n\n### Age ratio\n\nIt is the proportion of population in a given age group to its adjacent age groups, that is the successive and the preceding age groups.\n\n### Age\n\nAge is the interval of time between the day, month and year of birth and the day, month and year of occurrence of the event expressed in the largest completed unit of solar time such as years for adults and children and months, weeks, days, hours or minutes of life, as appropriate, for infants under one year of age.\n\n### Age-sex accuracy index\n\nIt is an index that combines both the sex ratio and the age ratio for both males and females to generate a joint score. The score is used to evaluate the quality of age and sex data in population censuses or surveys.\n\n### Age-Specific Fertility Rate\n\n Refers to the annual number of births to women of a specified age or age group per 1,000 women in that age group.\n\n### Annulment of a marriage\n\nThe invalidation or voiding of a marriage by a competent authority, according to the laws of each country, which confers on the parties the status of never having been married to each other.\n\n### Base population\n\nIt is the starting or reference population on which population projections are based. In most cases the enumerated population is used as a base population.\n\n### Birth (or parity) order\n\nBirth (or parity) order refers to the numerical order of the live birth or foetal death, recorded in relation to all previous pregnancy outcomes of the mother, irrespective of whether the outcome is a live birth or foetal death or whether pregnancies were nuptial or extranuptial.\n\n### Birth registration\n\nRefers to the process of recording a child's birth. It is a permanent and official record of a child's existence and provides legal recognition of that child's identity. It establishes a legal record of where the child was born and who the child's parents are.\n\n### Burial permit\n\nA burial permit is an official statement authorising the removal of the dead body (corpse) to the cemetery.\n\n### Child Headed Household\n\nA household whose head and main decision maker or source of livelihood is below the age of 18 years.\n\n### Children Ever Born (CEB)\n\nRefers to the life-time fertility experience of women 12 years and above. It is the total number of children a woman has given birth to in her lifetime.\n\n### Cohort\n\nA cohort is a group of people who experienced the same demographic event during a particular period of time. This will most commonly refer to births during a set period of time, but may also refer to marriages, onset of puberty, migration, first birth etc.\n\n### Completeness of registration of a vital event\n\nThis is the proportion of vital events that are registered. It is the number of registered vital events divided by an estimate of the actual number of vital events that occurred in the same population during a specific period of time.\n\n### Content errors\n\nThese are errors in the characteristics of persons counted, resulting from incorrect reporting or recording or from failure to report.\n\n### Coverage errors\n\nThese are non-sampling errors that result from omitting a unit that should have been included, including a unit more than once, or including a unit that should not have been included.\n\n### Crude divorce rate\n\nThe crude divorce rate is the number of divorces occurring among the population of a given geographical area during a given year, per 1,000 mid-year total population of the given geographical area during the same year.\n\n### Crude marriage rate\n\nThe crude marriage rate is the number of marriages occurring among the population of a given geographical area during a given year, per 1,000 mid-year total population of the given geographical area during the same year.\n\n### Current Fertility\n\nRefers to births that occurred to a woman in the 12 months before the census or survey date.\n\n### Date of birth\n\n The date of birth is the hour (minute), day, month and year of birth established in order that exact age may be determined in completed years, months, days, hours (minutes) of life as required.\n\n### De facto population\n\n De facto population consists of all persons who are physically present in the country or area of enumeration at the population and housing census enumeration reference date, whether or not they are usual residents.\n\n### De jure population\n\nDe jure population consists of all usual residents, whether or not they are present at the time of the population and housing census enumeration.\n\n### Death\n\nDeath is the permanent disappearance of all evidence of life at any time after the occurrence of live birth, i.e., the postnatal cessation of vital functions without capability of resuscitation. This definition excludes foetal deaths.\n\n### Defacto female headed household\n\nIs the household where the husband is not present and the wife becomes the main decision maker in his absence during a survey or census data collection exercise.\n\n### Defacto Population Census\n\nThe collection of basic social, demographic and economic data for all people who will have spent a specified night in the reference area. A de facto census involves counting people who spent a specified night in a household or an institution.\n\n### Dejure female headed household\n\nIs the household where the main decision maker is a female who has never been married or is divorced or is legally separated or widowed during a data collection exercise.\n\n### Dejure Population Census\n\nThe collection of basic social, demographic and economic data for all the people who normally reside in the country. It will exclude visitors from other countries and include residents who will be outside the country at the time of enumeration. At household or institution level the dejure census includes only the usual members. The problem with the dejure census is to define the \"usual member\" of a household or an institution.\n\n### Delayed Registration of a vital event\n\nThe registration of a vital event after the prescribed period denoted in existing laws, rules, or regulations (including any grace period, if one is specified). A late registration is the registration of a vital event after the prescribed time period but within a specified grace period. In Kenya, the grace period is from the third to sixth month following the event.\n\n### Demographic transition\n\nThe demographic transition is the process by which populations move from high mortality and fertility rates to low mortality and fertility rates as a country develops from a pre-industrial to an industrialized economic system. This is typically demonstrated through a demographic transition model. As fertility decline often lags behind mortality decline, there is an intermediate phase in the middle of the transition characterised by high growth rates.\n\n### Divorce\n\nDivorce is the final legal dissolution of a marriage; a separation of husband and wife that confers on the parties the right to remarriage under civil, religious and/or other provisions in accordance with the laws of the country.\n\n### Dual events\n\nAre those occurring simultaneously in the lives of two individuals, which cannot occur again in the life of either individual without a previous change to his or her status. Those events include marriage, registered partnership, separation, divorce, legal dissolution of registered partnerships and annulment of marriage.\n\n### Dual records system\n\nA dual records system is the simultaneous collection of vital events, mainly births and deaths and the appropriate exposed-to-the-risk population, by two collecting methods which, ideally, are independent of each other:\n\na\\) a continuous vital event recording procedure which may be other than the civil registration system; and\n\nb\\) a periodic household sample survey conducted in the same geographical area.\n\nMatching of the events reported by the two procedures provides methods of improving the estimate of the total number of vital events.\n\n### Duration of marriage\n\nThe duration of a marriage refers to the interval of time between the day, month and year of marriage to date. It is often expressed in completed years.\n\n### Dwelling Unit\n\nThis is a place of abode or residence with a private entrance. There can be many dwelling units within a structure. A dwelling unit may have one or more habitable rooms.\n\n### Enumerator\n\nA person who collects the required information from the enumeration area through interviews or any other method of obtaining information.\n\n### Family\n\nA group of persons who are related by blood, marriage, or adoption and who usually live together in the same household.\n\n### Female Headed Household\n\nA household whose primary decision-maker or source of livelihood (income) is a woman.\n\n### Fertility\n\nIs the actual number of live births a woman has had by the end of her reproductive life span (15-49 years).\n\n### Foetal Death\n\nFoetal Death is death prior to the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of the period of gestation. Death is indicated by the fact that after such separation, the foetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles.\n\n### Habitable Rooms\n\nHabitable rooms are defined as places/spaces in the dwelling unit that are used mainly for living and exclude stores, granaries, offices, toilets and garages.\n\n### Head of Household\n\nIs the most responsible member of a household who makes key decisions of the household on a day-to-day basis and whose authority is recognized by all members of the household. It could be the father, mother or a child, or any other responsible member within the household.\n\n### Homestead\n\nIt is an isolated compound with one or more structures, and may be inhabited by one or more households. In most cases, fences, hedges, walls, etc. surround homesteads. A homestead may contain, for example, a hut or a group of huts. A manyatta, thus is considered as a homestead. However, a wall/fence or hedge need not necessarily surround a homestead. For instance, boys' quarters, garage, kitchen, etc. may be part of a homestead whether or not they are surrounded by a fence/wall, etc.\n\n### Household Member\n\nA person who normally lives in a household and is either present or temporarily away from the household for a period of less than six months at the time of enumeration. This excludes visitors.\n\n### Household\n\nIs a person or a group of persons who reside in the same homestead or compound but not necessarily in the same dwelling unit. They have the same cooking arrangement and are answerable to the same household head.\n\n### Housing census\n\nA housing census is the total process of planning, collecting, processing, analysing, disseminating and evaluating statistical data relating to the number and condition of housing units and facilities as available to the households pertaining, at a specified time, to all living quarters and occupants thereof in a country or in a well-delimited part of a country.\n\n### Illegitimate child\n\nAn illegitimate child is the child of parents who, according to national law or customs, were not married at the time of its birth.\n\n### Judicial (legal) separation\n\nA judicial (legal) separation is the disunion of married persons according to the laws of each country, without conferring on the parties the right to remarriage.\n\n### Late Registration of a vital event\n\nA late registration is the registration of a birth or death after the legally specified time period but within a specified grace period. The grace period is usually considered to be six months after the vital event.\n\n### Legitimation\n\nThe formal investing of a person with the status and rights of a person born in wedlock, according to the laws of each country.\n\n### Lifetime Fertility\n\nRefers to the total number of children ever born alive during the entire reproductive period of the woman.\n\n### Live Birth\n\nLive Birth is the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother of a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy, which after such separation breathes or shows any other evidence of life such as beating of the heart, pulsation of the umbilical cord, or definite movement of voluntary muscles, whether or not the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta is attached; each product of such a birth is considered live-born.\n\n### Male Headed Household\n\nA household whose primary decision-maker or source of livelihood (income) is a man.\n\n### Marriage\n\nAn act, ceremony or process by which the legal relationship of spouses is constituted. The legality of the union may be established by civil, religious or other means as recognized by the laws of each country. Countries may wish to expand the definition to cover civil unions if they are registered. In that case, registered partnership usually refers to a legal construct, entailing registration with the public authorities according to the laws of each country, that becomes the basis for legal conjugal obligations between two persons.\n\nMatching of the events reported by the two procedures provides methods of improving the estimate of the total number of vital events.\n\n### Medium-size Urban Centres\n\nThese are centres with a population of more than 10,000 but less than 100,000 people.\n\n### Nuptiality\n\nRefers to the frequency of marriages between persons of opposite sexes which involve rights and obligations fixed by law or custom.\n\n### Parity\n\nThe total number of live births a woman has ever had. Women who have never had a live birth may be referred to as nulliparous. Women who have had one live birth are primiparous, and those with more than one live birth are multiparous.\n\n### Population Census\n\nThe total process of planning, collecting, processing, analysing, disseminating and evaluating demographic, economic and social data at the smallest geographic level pertaining, at a specified time, to all persons in a country or in a well-delimited part of a country.\n\n### Population Change\n\nThe increase or decrease of the total population or one of its structural units within a given time interval. The components of change in total population are births, deaths and migration.\n\n### Population Density\n\nPopulation density is calculated as the total population divided by the total area which that population resides in. It provides a simple measure of the pressure of population on space and resources. Problems may arise when population density is calculated for countries with large areas which are uninhabitable, as it may give an impression of \"emptiness\" when actually the population is crowded in small areas within the total territory.\n\n### Population Distribution\n\nThe arrangement of the population in space at a given time, that is geographically or among the various types of residential areas.\n\n### Population Projection\n\nIt is an estimate of future population by considering changes in a population due to fertility (births), mortality (deaths) and migration.\n\n### Population Pyramid\n\nA diagram showing the comparison of a human population by sex and age at a given time, consisting of a pair of histograms, one for each sex, laid horizontally in ascending order of age groups with a common base. The diagram is intended to provide a quick overall comparison of the age and sex structure of the population.\n\n### Population Size\n\nThe total number of persons/units in a specified area at a specified point in time\n\n### Population Structure\n\nThe distribution of the population by sex and age groups\n\n### Population/Demographic Momentum\n\nPopulation momentum refers to the inbuilt potential for growth (or decline) inherent in a population’s age-sex structure. It is the amount a population would increase (or decrease) in size, if the fertility of the population changed immediately to replacement level.\n\n### Recognition\n\nIs the legal acknowledgement, either voluntarily or compulsorily, of the paternity of a child born out of wedlock.\n\n### Respondent\n\nA respondent is the person who provides answers to the interviewer or the person who records the answers in a self-administered questionnaire.

It is obtained by summing up all age-specific fertility rates for each year of the childbearing span.\n\n### Type of marriage\n\nType of marriage is the type of act, ceremony or process by which the legal relationship of husband and wife is constituted, that is, whether civil, religious or customary.\n\n### Usual Residence\n\nThe place at which the person has lived continuously for most of the last 12 months (that is, for at least six months or for at least the last 12 months, not including temporary absences for holidays or work assignments) or intends to live for at least six months.\n\n### Verbal Autopsy (VA)\n\nVA is a process for diagnosing causes of death based on responses collected from families and/or caregivers to a series of structured questions on the signs and symptoms experienced by the deceased, and their duration. These responses are usually reviewed by a physician to determine the probable cause of death.\n\n### Vertical family events\n\nAre those involving a descendant; they comprise adoption, legitimation and recognition.\n\n### Vital Event Record\n\nA legal document entered in the civil register which attests to the occurrence and characteristics of a vital event.\n\n### Vital Events\n\nThe occurrence of a live birth, death, fetal death, marriage, divorce, adoption, legitimation, recognition of parenthood, annulment of marriage, or legal separation.\n\n### Vital statistical record\n\nA vital statistical record is a document or form, containing the items of information concerning an individual vital event or a number of vital events of the same type, filled in at the time of registration, to meet the needs of vital statistics compilation.\n\n### Vital statistics system\n\nIn the context of defining a system as a set of interacting or independent components forming an integrating whole and for the purposes of these principles and recommendations, the vital statistics system's components are (a) legal registration, (b) statistical reporting of, and (c) collection, compilation, and dissemination of statistics pertaining to vital events. The vital events of interest are live births, adoptions, legitimations, recognition; deaths and fetal deaths; and marriages, divorces, separations, and annulments of marriage.\n\n### Vital statistics\n\nThese constitute the collection of statistics on vital events in a lifetime of a person as well as relevant characteristics of the events themselves and of the person and persons concerned. Vital statistics provide crucial and critical information on the population in a country.\n\n### Youth Population\n\nRefers to population age 15-34 for training and age 15-24 as used in enrolment for international comparison.

These goods and services are referred to as consumer goods and services and their individual value is defined as the consumption expenditure on these goods or services. \n\n### Household income\n\nHousehold income is the sum of money income and income in kind and consists of receipts which, as a rule, are of a recurring nature and accrue to the household or to individual members of the household regularly at annual or at more frequent intervals (ILO,2000). Household income consists of receipts in cash, in kind or in services, that are usually recurrent and regular and are received by the household or by individual members of the household at annual or at more frequent intervals. During the reference period when they are received, such receipts are potentially available for current consumption and, as a rule, do not reduce the net worth of the household (ILO,2001). Income is thus defined in terms of a broad grouping of sources of income as follows:\n\n### Income from employment\n\nIncome from employment comprises receipts from involvement in economic activities, strictly in an employment-related capacity. It consists of employee income (e.g. wages) and self-employment income (return to labour), (ILO, 2000).\n\n### Employee income\n\nEmployee income consists of direct wages and salaries, cash bonuses and gratuities, commissions, directors’ fees, profit-sharing bonuses and other forms of profit-related pay, remuneration for time not worked (e.g. as sick leave or annual leave), free or subsidized goods and services from an employer as well as severance and termination pay. Employee income can be in cash (in the sense of monetary), in kind as goods or services.\n\n### Income from self employment\n\nIncome from self-employment is defined as the income which is received, over a given reference period, by individuals, for themselves or in respect of their family members, as a result of their current or former involvement in self-employment jobs” (ILO 2000). Income from self employment is taken as income received as a result of involvement in a self-employment job. It should be noted that this component is restricted to owners of unincorporated enterprises who work in such enterprises.\n\n### Property Income\n\nProperty incomeis income received from ownership of financial and other assets, e.g. interest payments. Property income consists of receipts received as a result of ownership of financial and non-financial assets that are provided to others for their use. These are usually in the form of interest receipts, dividends, rents received for the use of unproduced assets (natural resources), royalties for use of intellectual property and rents received for produced assets.\n\n### Income from household production of services for own consumption\n\nThis is income from household production of services for own consumption, e.g. services of owner-occupied housing, household production of domestic services for own consumption. These are services produced within the household for the household’s own consumption and not for the market. They include services from owner-occupied dwellings and from consumer durable goods owned as well as own-produced domestic services. They are valued net of expenses that go into their production\n\n### Transfers\n\nTransfers are receipts for which there is no “quid pro quo”, i.e. nothing tangible is given by the recipient to the donor in return for the receipts. Transfers may be made between households, between households and government or between households and charities. Transfers are mainly  motivated by the intention to redistribute income. Transfers can consist of cash (monetary) or goods or of services and can cross national boundaries. Capital transfers are one-off or irregular and are usually large, lump-sum receipts. In contrast, current transfers usually recur regularly and tend to be small. Current transfers are also mostly available for use in consumption expenditure during the reference period while recipients of capital transfers do not usually regard them as income and do not use them wholly for consumption expenditure during the reference period.\n\n### Current Transfers (in cash and goods)\n\nCurrent transfers whether in cash or goods consist of social security pensions/schemes; pensions and other insurance benefits; current transfers from non-profit institutions and current transfers from other households.\n\n### Current Transfers (Services)\n\nThese aresocial transfers in kind from government-provided services to individual households such as education, health, social welfare, transport and cultural services.\n\n### Holding gains\n\nHolding gains are changes in the value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities over a reference period which occur without any direct action of the owner, for example, changes in the value of stocks and shares. A holding gain, the result of an increase in assets or a reduction in liability, increases the net worth of the owner’s assets while a loss has the opposite effect.\n\n### Household Consumption Expenditure\n\nThis is the value of consumer goods and services that were acquired (used or paid for) by a household for the direct satisfaction of the needs and wants of its members through direct monetary purchases in the market; through the market-place but without using any money as means of payment (barter, income in kind); or from production within the household (own-account production).\n\n### Consumption expenditure on non-durable goods and services\n\nThis is expenditure incurred on goods including food items, personal care items, fuel, educational and entertainment items,  household items such as cleaning products and so on.\n\n### Consumption expenditure on durable goods\n\nThis is expenditure on household kitchen appliances, household information and entertainment appliances, other household appliances, household transportation equipment, other household items, clothing items, utensils, and so on. Consumer goods that are used many times over a long period of time without reducing their capacity to satisfy needs and wants are referred to as durable goods.\n\n### Intertemporal consumption\n\nIntertemporal consumption refers to how individuals allocate their consumption of goods and services across different time periods, typically balancing consumption today versus in the future. The decision is influenced by factors such as income, interest rates, time preferences, and expectations about the future.\n\n**Net Disposable Income**\n\n## Social Protection\n\nSocial protection is the systematic intervention intended to relieve households and individuals of the burden of a defined set of social risks.

Social insurance includes contributory pensions; health, unemployment, or disaster insurance; and funeral assistance. Social insurance is strongly linked to the formal labour market, meaning coverage is often limited to formal workers.\n\n### Social pensions\n\nThese are state pensions, a form of cash transfer targeted by age. Pensions are the most common social protection tool, with the widest global coverage and often highest national spend.

The concept of social security is based on ideas of human dignity and social justice. The underlying idea behind social security measures is that a citizen who has contributed or is likely to con­tribute to his/her country’s welfare should be given protection against certain hazards. The concept of social security, thus, is based on the ideals of human dignity and socio-economic justice. Underlying the concept is also the desire to give protection to its citizens to contribute to a coun­try’s total welfare against certain hazards of life to which they are exposed either in the working life or as a consequence of it.\n\n### The Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (CT-OVC)\n\nThis is a poverty-targeted and household-based programme with the objective of providing regular cash transfers to poor families living with children identified as OVCs to encourage fostering and retention of children and promote their human capital development.

Therefore, the participation rate for the activity is required, and two series of tables are presented:\n\n1.       Average time spent per day by the population and\n\n2.     Average time spent per day by persons who engaged in the activity.\n\nBasic time use statistics typically provide estimates of the average time spent per day on various types of activities by individuals within specific demographic groups. These categories may include men, women, boys, and girls within certain age groups, as well as distinctions such as rural or urban residence, employment status, and more. To ensure accurate averages, time use data should encompass both weekdays and weekends, and account for seasonal variations throughout the year.\n\n### Participation rate\n\nThe participation rate refers to the proportion of individuals in the survey population who took part in a specific activity during the reference period, such as in  the last 24 hours.\n\n### Time slot\n\nA one-hour interval within a 24-hour period during which respondents reported one or more activities.\n\n### Simultaneous activities\n\nSimultaneous activities are those undertaken by the same person at the same time and place.

It is used to compare the relative welfare or standard of living in different countries in a particular period.\n\n#### Gross Output\n\nOutput that consists of goods or services that are produced within an establishment that become available for use outside that establishment, plus any goods and services produced for own final use.\n\n#### Intermediate Consumption\n\nConsists of the value of the goods and services consumed as inputs by a process of production, excluding fixed assets whose consumption is recorded as consumption of fixed capital; the goods or services may be either transformed or used up by the production process.\n\n#### Gross Value Added (GVA)\n\nGVA is derived as the gross output less the intermediate consumption.\n\n#### Compensation of Employees\n\nThis is the total remuneration in cash or in kind paid to employees and comprises wages and salaries and the value of social contributions paid by employers.\n\n#### Operating Surplus\n\nThe operating surplus measures the surplus or deficit accruing from production before taking account of any interest, rent or similar charges payable on financial or tangible non-produced assets borrowed or rented by the enterprise, or any interest, rent or similar receipts receivable on financial or tangible non-produced assets owned by the enterprise; (note: for unincorporated enterprises owned by households, this component is called \"mixed income\").\n\n#### Mixed Income\n\nThe surplus or deficit accruing from production by unincorporated enterprises owned by households; it implicitly contains an element of remuneration for work done by the owner, or other members of the household, that cannot be separately identified from the return to the owner as entrepreneur, but it excludes the operating surplus coming from owner-occupied dwellings.\n\n#### Other Taxes on Production\n\nTaxes other than those incurred directly as a result of engaging in production; they mainly consist of current taxes on the labour or capital employed in the enterprise, such as payroll taxes or current taxes on vehicles or buildings.\n\n#### Basic Prices\n\nThe amount receivable by the producer from the purchaser for a unit of a good or service produced as output minus any tax payable, and plus any subsidy receivable, on that unit as a consequence of its production or sale; it excludes any transport charges invoiced separately by the producer.\n\n#### Purchasers’ Prices\n\nThe amount paid by the purchaser, excluding any deductible VAT or similar deductible tax, in order to take delivery of a unit of a good or service at the time and place required by the purchaser; the purchaser's price of a good includes any transport charges paid separately by the purchaser to take delivery at the required time and place.\n\n#### Government Final Consumption Expenditure\n\nExpenditure, including imputed expenditure, incurred by the general government on both individual consumption goods and services and collective consumption services.\n\n#### General Government\n\nThe sector consists of the totality of institutional units which, in addition to fulfilling their political responsibilities and their role of economic regulation, produce principally non-market services (possibly goods) for individual or collective consumption and redistribute income and wealth.\n\n#### Household/Private Final Consumption Expenditure (HFCE)\n\nExpenditure incurred by the resident households on final consumption of goods and services, whether made within or outside the economic territory.\n\n#### Final consumption expenditure by NPISH\n\nThe Private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) is defined as the expenditure incurred by the resident non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) on final consumption of goods and services, whether made within or outside the economic territory.\n\n#### Gross Fixed Capital Formation\n\nThis is measured as the total value of a producer's acquisitions, less disposals, of fixed assets during the accounting period plus certain additions to the value of non-produced assets realised by the productive activity of institutional units. Expenditure on mineral exploration and military ware not used purely for war purposes are included in GFCF. However, intangible assets, such as copyrights, computer software etc, are not included due to unavailability of reliable data.\n\n#### Fixed Assets\n\nTangible or intangible assets produced as outputs from processes of production that are themselves used repeatedly or continuously in other processes of production for more than one year.\n\n#### Consumption of Fixed Capital\n\nConstitutes the decline in the value of the fixed assets owned by an enterprise, as a result of their physical deterioration and normal rates of obsolescence and accidental damage. In other words it is the wear and tear of an asset during the accounting period.\n\n#### Changes in Inventories\n\nChanges in inventories (including work-in-progress) consist of changes in :(a) stocks of outputs that are still held by the units that produced them prior to their being further processed, sold, delivered to other units or used in other ways; and(b) stocks of products acquired from other units that are intended to be used for intermediate consumption or for resale without further processing; they are measured by the value of the entries into inventories less the value of withdrawals and the value of any recurrent losses of goods held in inventories.\n\n#### GDP by Production Approach\n\nThe production approach, which is also called the output approach, measures GDP as the difference between value of output less the value of goods and services used in producing these outputs during an accounting period\n\n#### GDP by Expenditure Approach\n\nGDP by expenditure approach also known as the aggregate demand is defined as private final consumption expenditure + government final consumption expenditure + gross capital formation + exports - imports.\n\n#### GDP by Income approach\n\nThe income approach estimates GDP as the sum of the incomes receivable by each institutional sector from the domestic production of goods and services.\n\n#### Gross National Income (GNI)\n\nThe aggregate value of the gross balances of primary incomes for all sectors. GNI is the gross domestic product, plus net receipts from abroad of compensation of employees, property income and net taxes less subsidies on production.\n\n#### Gross National Disposable Income\n\nGross national disposable income may be derived from gross national income by adding all current transfers in cash or in kind receivable by resident institutional units from non-resident units and subtracting all current transfers in cash or in kind payable by resident institutional units to non-resident units.\n\n#### Saving\n\nNet saving is net disposable income less final consumption expenditure.\n\n#### Net Lending/Borrowing\n\nNet amount a unit or a sector has available to finance, directly or indirectly, other units or other sectors; it is the balancing item in the capital account and is defined as: (Net saving plus capital transfers receivable minus capital transfers payable) minus (the value of acquisitions less disposals of non-financial assets, less consumption of fixed capital); negative net lending may also be described as \"net borrowing\".\n\n#### GDP Statistical Discrepancy\n\nThis is the difference between GDP compiled by the various approaches, e.g. the difference between GDP by production approach and GDP by expenditure approach.\n\n#### Supply and use Tables\n\nThe Supply Table describes how goods and services become available in an economy during a certain period of time. Products are either produced in the domestic industry or imported.  The Use Table shows how goods and services are used in the economy during a certain period of time.\n\n#### Input-Output Tables\n\nAn input-output table is a means of presenting a detailed analysis of the process of production and the use of goods and services (products) and the income generated in that production.; they can be either in the form of (a) supply and use tables or (b) symmetric input-output tables.\n\n#### Social Accounting Matrices (SAM)\n\nA means of presenting the SNA accounts in a matrix which elaborates the linkages between a supply and use table and institutional sector accounts; a typical focus of a SAM on the role of people in the economy may be reflected by, among other things, extra breakdowns of the household sector and a disaggregated representation of labour markets (i.e., distinguishing various categories of employed persons).\n\n#### Satellite Accounts\n\nSatellite accounts provide a framework linked to the central accounts and which enables attention to be focussed on a certain field or aspect of economic and social life in the context of national accounts; common examples are satellite accounts for the environment, or tourism, or unpaid household work.\n\n### Balance of payments and international investment position\n\n#### Balance of Payments\n\nA systematic statistical statement that summarizes for a given period (e.g. calendar year), an economy’s transactions with the rest of the world. BOP captures transactions between residents and nonresidents, irrespective of the currency in which the transaction is made. BOP comprises the Current Account (Goods and Services; Primary Income; and Secondary Income) and the Capital and Financial Accounts.\n\n#### Current Account\n\nThe current account focuses on transactions related to the exchange of goods, services, income, and current transfers. It consists of Goods, Services, Primary Income and Secondary Income sub-accounts.\n\n#### Goods Account\n\nIncludes the export and import of physical goods (merchandise). It also includes trade in goods by a resident and subsequent resale of these goods without them being physically present in the country. This concept is referred to as merchanting.\n\n#### Services Account\n\nIt covers the export and import of services. These are categorized into twelve broad categories in the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition (BPM6) as follows; Manufacturing of Physical Inputs owned by Others; Maintenance and Repair Services; Transport; Travel; Construction; Insurance and Pension Services; Financial Services; Charges for the use of  intellectual property n.i.e; Telecommunications, Computer and Information Services; Other Business Services (including Trade, Technical and related services,Research and development services, professional and management consulting services, waste treatment and depollution, agricultural and mining services, operating leasing, Trade related services ; Personal, cultural and recreation services; and Government  goods and services n.i.e\n\n#### Primary Income Account\n\nPrimary income captures returns for the provision of labor and financial assets; and renting of natural resources between resident and non-resident entities. This account records compensation of employees, income from investments such as dividends, interest, reinvested earnings; investment income attributable to policyholders in insurance, standardized guarantees, and pension funds; and rent.\n\n#### Secondary Income Account\n\nThis account records transfers of money or value between residents and non-residents, where no goods or services are exchanged. This includes:\n\n·       Personal transfers: All current transfers in cash or in kind made or received by resident households to or from nonresident households. They include remittances sent by workers to their families in their home countries.\n\n·       Other current transfers: These include Social contributions, social benefits,net premiums and claims on non-life insurance, Contributions from foreign governments, charitable donations, and other financial transfers, including aid and gifts.\n\n#### Current Account Balance\n\nThe current account balance is the sum of the balances of the four sub-accounts:\n\nCurrent Account Balance (CAB) = Balance of the Goods Account + Services Account Balance + Balance in the Primary Income Account + Balance in the Secondary Income Account\n\n#### Current Account Surplus/Deficit\n\nA current account surplus occurs when a country earns more income from abroad than it spends i.e. the CAB is a positive value. On the other hand, a current account deficit results from greater expenditure on goods produced or services rendered by non-residents as well as increased payments on factors of production, including interest and labour.\n\n#### Capital Account\n\nThis account shows (a) capital transfers receivable and payable between residents and nonresidents and (b) the acquisition and disposal of non-produced, nonfinancial assets between residents and nonresidents.\n\nCapital transfers are transfers in which the ownership of an asset (other than cash or inventories) changes from one party to another; or which obliges one or both parties to acquire or dispose of an asset (other than cash or inventories); or where a liability is forgiven by the creditor. This include debt forgiveness, investment grants, one-off guarantees and debt assumption, large gifts and inheritances (legacies), including those to nonprofit  institutions; cash grants from donor governments or multilateral financial institutions to the debtor economy to be used to repay debt\n\nNon-produced, non-financial assets consist of natural resources, contracts, leases and licenses; and marketing assets (including goodwill).\n\n#### Financial Account\n\nThis account records transactions that involve financial assets and liabilities that take place between residents and nonresidents. It tracks cross-border investments and transactions that change the ownership of financial assets and liabilities. The financial account indicates the functional categories, sectors, instruments and maturities used for net international financing transactions. Entries in the financial account can be corresponding entries to goods, services, income, capital account, or other financial account entries. The financial account shows net acquisition of financial assets and net incurrence of liabilities. There are five functional categories in the Financial Account which include Direct Investment, Portfolio Investment, Other Investment, Financial Derivatives  and Reserve Assets.\n\n#### Direct Investment\n\nThis arises when an entity, resident in one economy has equity shareholding or equivalent voting rights of 10% per cent or more in an entity resident in another economy that gives rise to a significant degree of influence or control in the management of this non-resident entity. A significant degree of influence exists when the non-resident Direct Investor has shareholding or equivalent voting rights of between 10 to 50 per cent of the value resident entity while control exists when the shareholding is more than 50 per cent.\n\nEnterprises in a direct investment relationship with each other are called affiliates or affiliated enterprises. In addition, all enterprises that are under the control or influence of the same direct investor are considered to be in a direct investment relationship with each other.\n\n#### Portfolio Investment\n\nThis is defined as cross border transactions and positions involving debt or equity securities, other than those included in direct investment or reserve assets. Investments by a non-resident in an economy in form of shares/voting rights of less than 10% (equity securities) and/or investment in financial instruments which are tradable (debt/non-equity securities). The negotiability of securities is a way of facilitating trading, allowing them to be held by different parties during their lives.\n\nPortfolio investment covers, but is not limited to, securities traded on organized or other financial markets and usually involves financial infrastructure, such as a suitable legal, regulatory, and settlement framework, along with market-making dealers, and a sufficient volume of buyers and sellers. Transactions in listed equity in the Securities markets or organized exchanges constitute Portfolio Investment.\n\n#### Other Investment\n\nThis captures any other investment by a non-resident in an economy that cannot be classified either as Direct Investment, Portfolio Investment, financial derivatives and employee stock options; and reserve assets. This comprises other equity (less than 10% of voting rights and non-tradable); currency and deposits; loans (including the use of IMF credit and loans from the IMF); trade credits and advances; insurance, pension and standardized guarantee schemes; accounts payable and receivable; and SDR allocations.\n\nOther investments may be split by financial asset or liability class, original or remaining maturity, or institutional sector.\n\n#### Reserve Assets\n\nReserve assets are those external assets that are readily available to and controlled by monetary authorities for meeting balance of payments financing needs, for intervention in exchange markets to affect the currency exchange rate, and for other related purposes (such as maintaining confidence in the currency and the economy; and serving as a basis for foreign borrowing). This includes central bank holdings of foreign exchange reserves, monetary gold, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) holdings, Reserve Position in the Fund and debt securities .\n\n#### International Investment Position\n\nInternational Investment Position (IIP) is a statistical statement that shows at a point in time the value and composition of financial assets of residents of an economy that are claims on nonresidents and gold bullion held as reserve assets; and liabilities of residents of an economy to non residents. The key components of IIP are similar to the components of the Financial Account of the Balance of Payments and include Direct Investment Assets/Liabilities, Portfolio Investment Assets/Liabilities, Other Investment Assets/Liabilities, Financial derivatives and Reserve Assets.\n\nThe difference between an economy’s external financial assets and liabilities is the economy’s net IIP, which may be positive or negative.\n\n#### Financial Assets\n\nThese are financial claims by residents of a country on non-residents/rest of the world. The existence of the counterpart liability distinguishes financial assets from other economic assets, such as land, dwellings, machinery, equipment, etc.\n\n#### Financial Liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are financial claims on residents by non-residents/rest of the world.\n\n#### Rest of the world\n\nConsists of all non-resident institutional units that enter into transactions with resident units, or have other economic links with resident units.\n\n#### Residency\n\nA resident is an individual, entity or organization located in an economic territory, with which it has the centre of predominant economic interest. An enterprise incorporated in Kenya is considered a resident of Kenya irrespective of the location of the owners of the enterprise. A branch of a foreign enterprise operating (or intending to operate) in Kenya for more than a year is treated as a resident of Kenya. A household is resident in the economic territory in which household members maintain or intend to maintain a dwelling or succession of dwellings treated and used by members of the household as their principal dwelling. If an individual is present in a territory for one year or more or intending to do so is sufficient to qualify as having a principal dwelling there. If there is uncertainty about the principal dwelling, the length of time spent there should inform whether they are resident or not.\n\nA legal entity is resident in the economic territory under whose laws the entity is incorporated or registered. If there is no incorporation or registration, legal domicile is used to ascertain the residence of the entity.\n\nA Non Profit Institutions Serving Households (NPISH) has a center of economic interest in the economy in which the institution was legally created and is officially recognized and recorded as a legal or social entity. When an NPISH is engaged in charity or relief work on an international scale, it may maintain substantial operations for individual territories that may amount to branches.\n\nAn exception to this rule includes the following:\n\n1.       Diplomats of Foreign Governments, Embassies, Military bases of foreign governments, cross-border workers, Patients and Students who are residents of their economies.\n\n2.     International/multilateral organizations who are not residents of any Government e.g. World Bank Group, International Monetary Fund. International organizations are resident in an economic territory of their own, and not of the economy in which they are physically located. Some international organizations cover a group of economies in a particular region, such as with economic or currency unions. If statistics are prepared for that region as a whole, these regional organizations are residents of the region as a whole, even though they are not residents of any member economy.\n\n#### Transactions\n\nA transaction is an interaction between two institutional units that occurs by mutual agreement or through the operation of the law and involves an exchange of value or a transfer. Transactions are classified according to the nature of the economic value provided—namely, goods or services, primary income, secondary income, capital transfers, nonproduced non-financial assets, financial assets, or liabilities. Transactions recorded in the BOP. are interactions between a resident and a nonresident institutional unit.\n\n#### Positions\n\nStock of financial assets and liabilities at a specific point in time and are recorded in the IIP.\n\n#### Financial Instruments\n\nThese are financial contracts made between institutional units and can be broadly divided into:\n\n·       Equity and Investment Fund shares: These include shares and other forms of ownership in an enterprise.\n\n·       Non-Equity/Debt Instruments: These include currency and deposits, debt securities, loans, trade credits and advances; other accounts receivables/payables, insurance, pension and standardized guarantee schemes, financial derivatives and employee stock options are also included in other financial instruments.\n\n#### Reinvested Earnings\n\nIncome on equity not paid out to investors as dividends but retained in the enterprise (e.g., retained profits).\n\n#### Revaluations\n\nChanges in the value of assets due to price changes and reflect nominal hold- ing gains and losses on environmental assets. The nominal holding gain for environmental assets is calculated in the same way as for non-financial assets, as the increase in value accruing to the owner of the asset as a result of a change in its price over a period of time. Holding gains and losses are realized when the asset is sold or liability extinguished. Holding gains and losses on unsold assets and unpaid liabilities are unrealized but are recorded as revaluations.\n\n#### Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)\n\nSDRs are an international reserve asset created by the IMF, used to supplement its member countries' official reserves. SDR holdings represent unconditional rights to obtain foreign exchange or other reserve assets from other IMF members. SDR holdings are classified as reserve assets in while SDR allocations are captured in Other Investments liabilities.\n\n#### Valuation Principles\n\nValuation principles for measuring cross-border transactions and positions are market prices or book values for assets and liabilities.\n\n#### Accrual Accounting\n\nAccrual accounting records flows at the time economic value is created, transformed, exchanged, transferred, or extinguished. This means that flows that imply a change of economic ownership are recorded when ownership passes and services are recorded when provided, irrespective of whether cash was received or paid or was due to be received or paid.\n\n#### Market Value\n\nMarket prices for transactions are defined as amounts of money that willing buyers pay to acquire something from willing sellers; the exchanges are made between independent parties and on the basis of commercial considerations only—sometimes called “at arm’s length”. Transactions in loans, deposits, and other accounts receivable/ payable also should be valued at market prices. Transactions in financial assets and liabilities should be recorded exclusive of any commissions, fees, and taxes whether charged explicitly, included in the purchaser’s price, or deducted from the seller’s proceeds. When market prices for transactions are not observable, valuation according to market-equivalent prices provides approximation to market prices. In such cases, market prices of the same or similar items when such prices exist will provide a good basis for applying the principle of market prices.\n\n#### Book Value\n\nThe value recorded in the enterprises records.\n\n#### Nominal Value\n\nThe outstanding amount the debtor owes to the creditor, which is composed of the outstanding principal amount including any accrued interest. Therefore, the nominal value reflects the sum of funds originally advanced, plus any subsequent advances, plus any interest that has accrued, less any repayments (which includes any payments covering interest accrual). If a debt instrument is denominated in foreign currency, the corresponding nominal value of the instrument in domestic currency also includes holding gains or losses arising from exchange rate changes.\n\n#### Amortized value\n\nThe amortized value of a loan reflects the process of gradual elimination of the liability by regular payments over a specified period of time. On the date of each scheduled payment, amortized value is the same as nominal value, but it may differ from the nominal value on other dates because nominal value includes interest that has accrued and not been paid.\n\n#### Face value\n\nThe undiscounted amount to be paid to the holder at maturity. It is also known as “par value” or simply “par.” Before maturity, the market value of a bond may be greater or lesser than the face value, depending on the interest rate payable and the perceived risk of default. As bonds approach maturity, market value approaches face value. For example, if interest rates are higher than the bond’s coupon rate, then the bond is sold at a discount (below par). Conversely, if interest rates are lower than the bond’s coupon rate, then the bond is sold at a premium (above par).\n\n#### Net Errors and Omissions\n\nIn practice, data may not perfectly match due to various statistical discrepancies, either from source data or from compilation. This gives rise to net errors and omissions. While net errors and omissions is a residual item, the size and trends may help identify data problems, such as coverage or misreporting. Patterns in net errors and omissions may provide useful information on data problems. While it is not possible to have guidelines on an acceptable size for net errors and omissions, it can be assessed in relation to other items, such as GDP, current account balance, positions data, and gross flows.\n\n#### Institutional Sectors\n\nBPM6 provides guidance for compilation of BOP and IIP by attributing institutional units to the following sectors:\n\n●       Central Bank\n\n○      Deposit taking Corporations except the Central Bank\n\n○      General government\n\n●       Other Sectors\n\n■       Other financial corporations\n\n●       Moneymarketfunds(MMFs)\n\n●       Non-MMF Investment funds\n\n●       Other financial intermediaries except insurance corporations and pension funds (ICPFs)\n\n●        Financial auxiliaries\n\n●       Captive financial institutions and money lenders\n\n●        Insurance corporations\n\n●       Pension funds\n\n■       Non-financial corporations, households, and NPISHs\n\n●       Nonfinancial corporations\n\n●        Households\n\n●       NPISHs (non-profit institutions serving households; maybe combined with households)\n\nThe full institutional sector detail is required for international accounts to be fully integrated with monetary, flow of funds, and other financial data.\n\n#### Exceptional Financing\n\nBrings together financial arrangements made by the authorities (or by other sectors fostered by authorities) of an economy to meet Balance of Payments needs. Arrears related to exceptional financing are recorded below the line as transactions in the analytical presentation of the Balance of Payments with the corresponding entry in the relevant instrument.\n\n#### The International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS)\n\nThis is a data collection system that obtains data from banks and companies at the level of individual transactions. An ideal ITRS measures: (1) cash transactions with nonresidents that pass through domestic banks; (2) cash transactions that pass-through enterprise accounts with banks abroad; (3) transactions on intercompany accounts with nonresident companies; (4) positions; and (5) noncash transactions.\n\nStatistics are compiled from forms submitted to/by domestic banks and from forms submitted by companies.\n\nHowever, the efficacy of the ITRS is based on the legal framework, accounting systems, and foreign exchange regulations of various economies. In Kenya, the ITRS is a major data source on cross border transactions. However, it is not sufficient to address all the BOP requirements hence the use of complimentary data sources, including surveys to enterprises.\n\n#### Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition\n\nThe Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition (BPM6) is a comprehensive set of guidelines published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It provides standards for compiling and presenting Balance of Payments (BOP) and International Investment Positions (IIP).\n\n### Government Finance Statistics\n\nCovers statistical activities on the general government sector and the broader public sector. It covers the compilation of data on revenues, expenditures, transactions in financial assets and liabilities, and balance sheet data.\n\n#### Classification of the Functions of Government (COFOG)\n\nClassification of the government outlays by functions, or socio-economic objectives, that general government units aim to achieve through the outlays.\n\n#### Economic classification\n\nClassification of government outlays used to identify the types of expense incurred when a government supplies goods and services to the community or redistributes income and wealth.\n\n#### Expense\n\nA transaction involving exchange and transfer that reduces the net worth of the government.\n\n#### Revenue\n\nA set of exchange and transfer transactions that increase the net worth of the government.\n\n#### Compensation of employees\n\nThe expense involving total remuneration, in cash or in kind, payable to a government employee in return for work done during the accounting period, except for work connected to own-account capital formation\n\n#### Use of Goods and Service\n\nAn expense that involves purchase of goods and services for production of market and nonmarket goods and services Plus goods purchased for resale Minus the change in inventories of materials, work-in- progress, finished goods, and goods held for resale. The value is recorded when goods or services are actually used rather than when they were acquired\n\n#### Interest\n\nThe expense that a government unit (debtor) incurs for use of the principal outstanding, which is the economic value that has been provided by the creditor. Interest accrues continuously over period that the liability exists\n\n#### Subsidies\n\nCurrent transfers that government units pay to enterprises either on the basis of the levels of their production activities or on the basis of the quantities or values of the goods or services that they produce, sell, or import.\n\n#### Social Benefits\n\nSocial benefits represent the government's financial contributions to support its citizens' welfare. They are typically non-market transfers (e.g., financial aid) aimed at improving economic security.\n\n#### Current Grants\n\nCurrent transfers are voluntary transfers from the central government to other levels of government for the purpose their current expenditure\n\n#### Capital Grants\n\nCapital transfers are voluntary transfers from the central government to other levels of government for the purpose of their capital expenditure\n\n#### Acquisition of Non-financial assets\n\nTransactions involving a monetary exchange for produced and non-produced fixed assets, inventories, valuables; most nonfinancial assets provide benefits either through their use in the production of goods and services or in the form of property income.\n\n#### Acquisition of Financial assets\n\nThese are transactions that entail the government to a financial claim from a second unit; the financial assets include participation of equity, monetary gold, and Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) allocated by the IMF.\n\n#### Public debt redemption\n\nTotal outlays during an accounting period towards principal repayment thus reducing the liabilities for the government\n\n#### Tax revenue\n\nTaxes are compulsory unrequited transfers to the general government sector from resident households and enterprises.\n\n#### Value Added Tax (VAT)\n\nA consumption tax levied at each stage of production of goods and services based on the value added to the product at that stage.\n\n#### Excise Duty\n\nTax levied on specific goods and commodities produced or sold within the country. The level of duty is dependent upon the Government policy to raise revenue, protect industries or discourage consumption.\n\n#### Import Duty\n\nA levy imposed on imported goods.\n\n#### Non-Tax Revenue\n\nCertain compulsory transfers, such as fines, penalties, and most social security contributions.\n\n#### Grants\n\nVoluntary unrequited transfers received/paid by government units from/to other government units or international organizations.\n\n#### Stock of Domestic Debt\n\nThe total stock of liabilities that the Government owes to residents.\n\n#### Stock of External Debt\n\nThe total stock of liabilities that the Government owes to non-residents.\n\n### Monetary and Financial Statistics\n\n#### Monetary statistics\n\nCovers the stock and flow of the financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities of an economy's financial corporations sector.\n\n#### Financial statistics\n\nCovers the stock and flow of the financial assets and liabilities of all sectors of an economy.\n\n#### Net foreign assets\n\nGross foreign assets less gross foreign liabilities of depository corporations\n\n#### Domestic credit\n\nCredit advanced by Depository Corporations to resident institutions and individuals\n\n#### Commercial banks\n\nA commercial bank is the most common designation of a deposit-taking corporation but use of the term “bank” in the name of an entity does not imply it is actually a commercial bank. It should be classified as a bank based on the types of activities undertaken and not based on the name alone. The most common services provided by commercial banks are accepting deposits and granting loans or other forms of finance to corporations and households.\n\n#### Micro Finance Institutions\n\nInstitutions providing financial services mainly credit, savings, insurance etc. to those sectors of the economy considered risky by commercial banks. Their target market is typically poor households and micro and small enterprises.\n\nThey can be classified into:\n\n1)         Microfinance banks\n\n2)         Non-deposit Microfinance\n\n3)         Digital Credit Providers\n\n#### Liquidity\n\nThe ability to sell assets quickly and in large volume without substantially affecting their price. A financial asset is liquid if, at short notice and minimum cost, it can be bought, sold, redeemed at, or close to, full value. This means that to be liquid, a financial asset must be exchangeable against a medium of exchange with minimum cost and time, and without unduly affecting the value of the asset.\n\n#### Deposits\n\nAll funds received or held by the reporting institution on behalf of third parties that are represented by evidence of deposit. This item covers the reporting institution’s deposit liabilities of all maturities with credit balances\n\n#### Loans\n\nFunds borrowed by the institutions and individuals from institutional units/sectors which are evidenced by on-negotiable documents, including credit cards.\n\n#### Non-performing loans\n\nA loan is non-performing when payments of interest or principal are past due by 90 days or more. However, the period by which institutions classify a loan as non performing may vary.\n\n#### Broad money supply (M1 M2 M3)\n\nThe main categories of money are:\n\na.     **M0** Currency outside the banking system excluding commemorative coins\n\nb.     **M1** M0 + demand deposits of banks (or depository corporations) plus other deposits at CBK\n\nc.      **Quasi Money** comprises of call plus 7 days deposits, savings and time deposits.\n\nd.     **Broad Money (M2)** M1 + Quasi (long term) money deposits (time and savings deposits of banks). This was previously M3. The previous M2 was this aggregate less both quasi-money deposits in non- bank financial institutions and their holding of cash in till and any deposits they hold in other banks.\n\ne.     **Extended Broad Money (M3)** M2 + resident foreign currency deposits.\n\nf.       **Overall Liquidity** M3 + non-bank holdings of Government securities\n\n#### Demand deposits\n\nDeposits which are subject to transfer by cashing out or cheques. Demand deposits consist of deposits (in local and foreign currency) which are immediately convertible into cash and which are transferable by cheque, banker’s order, debit entry etc, without significant restriction or penalty.\n\n#### Time deposits\n\nDeposits which are usually not subject to transfer by cheque and are lodged for a definite period, subject to advance notice of withdrawal.\n\n#### Saving deposits\n\nDeposits lodged for no fixed period. Certain conditions are applicable to depositors who wish to avail cheque facilities.\n\n#### Deposit taking financial corporations\n\nDeposit taking financial corporations have financial intermediation as their principal activity. They obtain funds through the acceptance of deposits or other financial instruments such as short-term certificates of deposits\n\n#### Capital account\n\nThe first of four accounts dealing with changes in the values of assets held by institutional units. It records the values of the non-financial assets that are acquired, or disposed of, by resident institutional units by engaging in transactions and to show the change in net worth due to saving and capital transfers.\n\n#### Real-time gross settlement\n\nA payment system where both processing and final settlement of funds transfer instructions take place continuously (i.e. in real time) from one bank to another.\n\n#### Central Bank Rate\n\nThe rate of interest Central Bank charges on loans to banks.\n\n#### Repo rate\n\nThe interest paid by the Central Bank to Commercial Banks for lending money in the repo market.

The distinguishing characteristic of the shifting cultivation is that neither fertilizers nor manure is used to replace soil fertility.\n\n#### Crop Rotation\n\nThe practice of growing a series of different types of crops in the same area in a sequence. It means that the succeeding crop belongs to a different family than the previous one. It helps in reducing soil erosion and increases soil fertility and crop yield.\n\n#### Land Under Temporary Crops\n\nIncludes all land used for crops with a less than one-year growing Cycle.\n\n#### Land Under Temporary Meadows and Pastures\n\nLand temporarily cultivated with herbaceous forage crops for mowing or pasture, as part of crop rotation periods of less than five years.\n\n#### Land Temporarily Fallow\n\nArable land at prolonged rest before re-cultivation.

Heat from non-concentrating solar thermal refers to low temperature heat produced from solar radiation captured by non-concentrating solar thermal systems. The heat can be used for applications, such as space heating, cooling, water heating, district heating and industrial processes.\n\n#### Energy Consumers\n\nIn energy statistics, energy consumers consist of economic units (enterprises and households) that act as final users of energy; they use energy products for energy purposes (heat raising, transportation and electrical services) and/or for non-energy purposes. It should be noted that the economic units belonging to the energy industries that use energy to produce other energy products are excluded from this group. Their energy use, by convention, is not part of the final consumption of energy and is considered separately as energy industries own use\n\n#### Transmission\n\nEnergy transmission refers to the process of transporting electrical energy, typically at high voltages, from power generation sources to substations, and then onward to distribution networks. It's a crucial part of the electrical power grid, ensuring that electricity generated at power plants can be delivered to where it is needed.\n\n#### Distribution\n\nThe process of delivering energy, primarily electricity, from generation sources to end-users\n\n#### Coal mines\n\nPlants extracting coal through underground or open-cast mining. In addition to the extraction activity itself, the operation of coal mines also includes operations such as grading, cleaning, compressing, etc., leading to a marketable product.\n\n#### Coke ovens\n\nLarge ovens within which coke oven coke, coke oven gas and coal tars are produced by high temperature carbonization of coking coal.\n\n#### Coal liquefaction plants\n\nPlants where coal is used as a feedstock to produce liquid fuels by hydrogenation or carbonization.

Note that the GTL plants are quite different from liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants, which convert gaseous natural gas into liquid natural gas.\n\n#### LNG plants/regasification plants\n\nPlants for carrying out liquefaction and/or regasification of natural gas for the purpose of transport. This activity can be carried out on or off the actual point of production.\n\n#### Oil and gas extraction\n\nActivities of extracting crude oil, mining and extracting oil from oil shale and oil sands, extracting natural gas and recovery of natural gas liquids. This includes overall activities of operating and/or developing oil and gas field properties, including\n\nsuch activities as drilling, completing and equipping wells, operating separators, emulsion breakers, desilting equipment and field gathering lines for crude petroleum and all other activities in the preparation of oil and gas up to the point of shipment from the producing site.\n\n#### Oil refineries\n\nPlants that transform crude oil and other hydrocarbons (together with additives, feedstocks and natural gas liquids) into finished oil products. Typical finished products are liquefied petroleum gases, naphtha, motor gasoline, gas oils, aviation fuels and other kerosene, and fuel oils.\n\n#### Charcoal plants\n\nPlants in which wood, or other vegetal matter is carbonized through slow pyrolysis to produce charcoal.\n\n#### Biogas production plants\n\nPlants for capturing and/or manufacturing biogases. Biogases arise from the anaerobic fermentation of biomass. They can be derived from several sources, including landfills, sewage sludge and agricultural residues. They also include synthesis gas produced from biomass.\n\n#### Nuclear fuel extraction and fuel processing plants\n\nPlants involved in the mining of ores are chiefly valued for their uranium and thorium content, the concentration of such ores, the production of yellowcake, the enrichment of uranium and thorium ores, and/or the production of fuel elements for nuclear reactors.\n\n#### Other energy industry not elsewhere specified\n\nThis is a residual category that refers to any energy industry not covered elsewhere in the list above. One example is the extraction of peat for energy purposes.\n\n#### Other energy producers\n\n**E**conomic units (including households) that choose, or are forced by circumstance, to produce energy for their own consumption and/or to supply energy to other units, but for which energy production is not their principal activity. These units are engaged in the production, transformation and transmission/distribution of energy as a secondary and/or ancillary activity. This means that the “energy” output generated by these activities and measured in terms of value added does not exceed that of the principal activity of the unit. In the case of ancillary activities, the activities are carried out to support the principal and secondary activity of the unit.\n\n#### Production\n\nThe capture, extraction or manufacture of fuels or energy in forms that are ready for general use. In energy statistics, two types of production are distinguished, primary and secondary.\n\n●             Primary production is the capture or extraction of fuels or energy from natural energy flows, the biosphere and natural reserves of fossil fuels within the national territory in a form suitable for use. Inert matter removed from the extracted fuels and quantities reinjected, flared or vented are **not** included. The resulting products are referred to as “primary” products.\n\n●             Secondary production is the manufacture of energy products through the process of transformation of other fuels or energy, whether primary or secondary. The quantities of secondary fuels reported as production include quantities lost through venting and flaring during and after production.\n\n#### Imports of energy products\n\nAll fuel and other energy products entering the national territory. Goods simply being transported through a country (goods in transit) and goods temporarily admitted are excluded, while re-imports (i.e. domestic goods exported but subsequently readmitted) are included. The bunkering of fuel outside the reference territory by national merchant ships and civil aircraft engaged in international travel is also excluded from imports. Note that the country of origin of energy products should be recorded, where possible, as the country from which goods were imported, but not a transit country.\n\n#### Exports of energy products\n\nAll fuel and other energy products leaving the national territory. Goods simply being transported through a country (goods in transit) and goods temporarily withdrawn are excluded, while re-exports (i.e. foreign goods exported in the same state as previously imported) are included. Also excluded are quantities of fuels delivered for use by merchant ships (including passenger ships) and civil aircraft of all nationalities during international transport of goods and passengers. Note that the country of destination of energy products (i.e. the country of the last known destination as it is known at the time of exportation) should be recorded as a country to which these products are exported to, but not a transit country.\n\nIt should be noted that the definitions of imports and exports used in energy statistics are those adopted by international merchandise trade statistics for a system of recording known as the general trade system, that is, all energy products entering and leaving the national territory of a country and which add to or are subtracted from the stock of material resources of a country are recorded as energy imports and exports, except for the bunkering of international fleet, which is excluded from trade figures. It should also be noted that, in energy balances, imports and exports exclude nuclear fuels as these are not within the scope of energy balances.\n\n#### International marine bunkers\n\nQuantities of fuels delivered to merchant ships (including passenger ships) of any nationality for consumption during international voyages transporting goods or passengers. International voyages take place when the ports of departure and arrival are in different national territories. Fuels delivered for consumption by ships during domestic transportation, fishing or military uses are not included here, but are considered part of final consumption of energy (see para. 5.94 for domestic navigation). For the purposes of energy statistics, international marine bunkers are not included in exports; they are recorded separately due to their importance, e.g. for the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n#### International aviation bunkers\n\nQuantities of fuels delivered to civil aircraft of any nationality for consumption during international flights transporting goods or passengers. International flights take place when the ports of departure and arrival are in different national territories. Fuels delivered for consumption by aircraft undertaking domestic or military flights are not included here, but are considered part of final consumption of energy. For the purposes of energy statistics, international aviation bunkers are not included in exports; they are recorded separately due to their importance, e.g. for the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n#### Stock changes\n\nFor the purposes of energy statistics, stocks are quantities of energy products that are held on the national territory and can be used to: (a) maintain service under conditions where supply and demand are variable in their timing or amount due to normal market fluctuations, or (b) supplement supply in the case of a supply disruption.Stocks used to manage a supply disruption may be called ”strategic” or “emergency” stocks and are often held separately from stocks designed to meet normal market fluctuations, but both are considered here. Stock changes are defined as the increase (stock build) or decrease (stock draw) in the quantity of stocks over the reporting period and thus are calculated as a difference between the closing and opening stocks.\n\n#### Transfers\n\nEssentially statistical devices to overcome practical classification and presentation issues resulting from changes in use or identity of a product. Transfers comprise products transferred and interproduct transfers. Products transferred refers to the reclassification (renaming) of products, which, for example, is necessary when finished oil products are used as feedstock in refineries. Interproduct transfers refer to the movements of fuels between product categories because of reclassification of a product that no longer meets its original specification. For example, aviation turbine fuel that has deteriorated or has been spoiled may be reclassified as heating kerosene.\n\n#### Transformation\n\nThe process where part or all of the energy content of a product entering a process moves from this product to one or more different products leaving the process (e.g., from coking coal to coke, from crude oil to oil products, or from fuel oil to electricity) (see section D.2 for further discussion).\n\n#### Losses\n\nLosses during the transmission, distribution and transport of fuels, heat and electricity. Losses also include venting and flaring of manufactured gases, losses of geothermal heat after production and pilferage of fuels or electricity. However, production of secondary gases includes quantities subsequently vented or flared. This ensures that a balance can be constructed between the use of the primary fuels from which the gases are derived and the production of the gases.\n\n#### Energy industries own use\n\nThe consumption of fuels and energy for the direct support of the production and preparation for use of fuels and energy, except heat not sold. As such, it covers not only own use by energy industries as defined in para. 5.23, but also by other energy producers. Quantities of fuels transformed into other fuels or energy are not included here, but within transformation; neither are quantities used within parts of the energy industry not directly involved in the activities listed in the definition.\n\nThese quantities are reported within final consumption.\n\n#### Non-energy use\n\nThe use of energy products as raw materials for the manufacture of products outside the scope of SIEC, as well as for direct uses that do not involve using the products as a source of energy, nor as a transformation input. Examples are lubrication, sealing, preservation, road surfacing and use as a solvent.\n\nFinal consumption refers to all fuel and energy delivered to users for both their energy and non-energy uses, and which do not involve a transformation process.\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe whole of any plant or equipment under one ownership designed for the supply or use of electrical energy.\n\n#### Public Lamp\n\nAn electric lamp used for the lighting of a street or a public place.\n\n#### Energy to GDP Ratio\n\nThe total value of energy produced as a proportion of the national GDP.\n\n#### Electricity/Energy Loss\n\nLosses are those that occur during the transmission, distribution and transport of fuels, electricity and heat.

It is sometimes expressed as weight per unit area of land or per unit volume of water.\n\n##### Capacity at peak\n\nThe available capacity of an installation at peak period is the maximum power at which it can be operated under the prevailing conditions at the time, assuming no external constraints. It depends on the technical state of the equipment and its ability to operate, and may differ from the Net maximum capacity due to lack of water for hydro capacity, plant maintenance, unanticipated shutdown, or other outages at the time of peak load\n\n##### Charcoal\n\nCovers the solid residue of the destructive distillation and pyrolysis of wood and other vegetal material. Since charcoal is a secondary product, its treatment is slightly different from that of the other primary biofuels. Production of charcoal (an output in the transformation process) is offset by the inputs of primary biofuels into the charcoal production process. The losses from this process are included in the transformation processes. Other supply (e.g. trade and stock changes) as well as consumption are aggregated directly with the primary biofuels. In some countries, only primary biofuels are reported.\n\n##### Coal and coal products\n\nCOAL (For balances only.) This is the sum of all primary coals (including peat, peat products or oil shale and oil sands) and all derived coal products (cokes, gases, tars, briquettes etc.).\n\n##### Coal transformation\n\nCoal transformation contains losses in transformation of coal from primary to secondary and from secondary to tertiary fuels (hard coal to coke, coke to blast furnace gas, lignite to BKB, etc.).\n\n##### Air Mass\n\nA large amount of air that has the same properties (temperature, water vapor, and stability).\n\n##### Dekad\n\nPeriod of ten consecutive days, sometimes used in the study of meteorological elements.\n\n##### Dew point\n\nThe temperature to which air must be cooled to create a cloud (or rain).\n\n##### Domestic\n\nIncludes fuels delivered to vessels of all flags not engaged in international navigation (see international marine bunkers).

Fuel used for ocean, coastal and inland fishing and military consumption are excluded.\n\n##### Domestic aviation\n\nIncludes deliveries of aviation fuels to aircraft for domestic aviation - commercial, private, agricultural, etc. It includes use for purposes other than flying, e.g. bench testing of engines, but not airline use of fuel for road transport. The domestic/international split should be determined on the basis of departure and landing locations and not by the nationality of the airline. Note that this may include journeys of considerable length between two airports in a country (e.g. San Francisco to Honolulu). For many countries this incorrectly includes fuel used by domestically owned carriers for outbound international traffic.\n\n##### Electricity output in GWh\n\nShows the total number of GWh generated by thermal power plants separated into electricity plants and CHP plants.

This property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapour (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and ozone (O3) are the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. Moreover, there are a number of entirely human-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as the halocarbons and other chlorine- and bromine-containing substances, dealt with under the Montreal Protocol.

If possible, fuel inputs and electricity/heat outputs are on a unit basis rather than on a plant basis.\n\nHowever, if data are not available on a unit basis, the convention for defining a CHP plant noted above should be adopted. Main activity producers generate electricity and/or heat for sale to third parties, as their primary activity. They may be privately or publicly owned. Note that the sale need not take place through the public grid.\n\n##### Main activity producer electricity plants\n\nPlants which are designed to produce electricity only.

Non-energy use is shown separately in final consumption under the heading non-energy use.\n\nNote that for biomass commodities, only the amounts specifically used for energy purposes (a small part of the total) are included in the energy statistics. Therefore, all non-energy use quantities are null by definition.\n\n##### Non-energy use\n\nNon-energy use covers those fuels that are used as raw materials in the different sectors and are not consumed as a fuel or transformed into another fuel. Non-energy use is shown separately in final consumption under the heading non-energy use.

These goods can be either imported directly or released by Customs from bonded warehouses.\n\n### Trade volume\n\nThis is the sum of Total Exports and Imports\n\n### Trade Balance\n\nThis refers to the total value of goods exported, minus the total value of goods imported by a given economy in a given period of time. A positive trade balance (trade surplus) indicates that a country is exporting more in value terms than it is importing. A negative trade balance (trade deficit) indicates that the country imports more as compared to what it exports.\n\n### Export-Import Cover ratio\n\nThis refers to the proportion of total exports to imports. It measures the proportion of import bills financed by export revenues. The higher the better for an economy.\n\n### Terms of Trade (TOT)\n\nTerms of Trade measure a country's export prices relative to its import prices. A higher term of trade means the export prices are increasing faster than import prices and the better for an economy.\n\n### Principal commodities\n\nThese are goods that either a country produces in abundance and sells to other nations, generating foreign currency for the country over time or goods that a country needs to buy from other economies because they either don’t produce them locally or lack the capacity to produce them in sufficient quantities.\n\n### Assessment Date\n\nThe date on which customs completes assessment of customs duties and other necessary assessments or inspections on the goods traded. It is at this time that a good is considered as an export or an import.\n\n### Import valuation\n\nImports are valued on cost insurance freight (**cif**) basis which means the import value of the commodity includes the cost/price of the goods, the transportation and insurance charges up to the custom frontiers of the importing country.\n\n### Export valuation\n\nExports are valued on a free on board (**fob**) basis which means the export value of the commodity includes the cost/price of the goods, the transportation and insurance charges if any up to the custom frontiers of the exporting country.\n\n### Trade Agreement\n\nAn agreement between two countries or more countries setting out the conditions under which trade between or amongst them will be conducted.\n\n### Common External Tariff (CET)\n\nThe uniform tariff rates applied by member states of a customs union against non-member states. Kenya is in the EAC Customs Union and therefore applies EAC-CET.\n\n### Applied Tariff Rate\n\nThe tariff rates imposed by customs when a good crosses the border.\n\n## Prices\n\n### Annual Inflation Rate\n\nThe annual inflation rate is the change in the overall index e.g. Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all items of the relevant month of the current year compared with the overall index for all items of the same month in the previous year expressed as a percentage.\n\n### Base Effect\n\nThe base effect refers to the impact of the rise in price level (i.e. last year’s inflation) in the previous year over the corresponding rise in the price levels in the current year (i.e. current inflation). The base effect therefore helps to explain the changes in the annual inflation or the rate at which it diminishes or grows compared to the previous month.\n\n### Base Period\n\nPeriod with which all periods are compared, and the value of the period is 100. It is a reference period for all periods in the index. The following types of base periods must be distinguished.\n\n       i.          **Index reference period:** this is the period for which the value of the index is set at 100.\n\n     ii.          **Price reference period:** the period that provides the prices to which the prices in other periods are compared. The prices of the price reference period appear in the denominators of the price relatives, or price ratios, used to calculate the index.\n\n   iii.          **Weight reference period:** this is the period/year for which the expenditure shares serve as the weights for a set of price relatives or elementary price indices.\n\n###  Basket of Goods and Services\n\nA national set of goods and services, specified in terms of commodity and quantity which are used for the compilation of an index. For the CPI it comprises goods and services that are acquired by households in the base period.\n\n### Brands\n\nThe trade name of the item which may be the manufacturer’s name or the name of the item. Note that the same brand name may be used for different items, e.g. cooking oil, maize, salt etc.\n\n### Central Product Classification (CPC)\n\nAn international classification of goods and services based on the physical characteristics of goods and services or on the nature of the services rendered.\n\n### Chain Index\n\nThis is an index number in which the value of any given period is related to the value of its immediately preceding period.\n\n### Chaining/Chain Linking\n\nThe construction of a continuous price series by multiplying together price indices that have been constructed using different weight reference periods. The resulting index is referred to as a chain index.\n\n### Classification of Individual Consumption according to Purpose (COICOP)\n\nThis is the international reference classification of household expenditure. The objective of COICOP is to provide a framework of homogeneous categories of goods and services, which are considered a function or purpose of household consumption expenditure. The classification has divisions, groups, classes, sub classes, micro classes and elementary aggregates.\n\n### Construction Input Price Index (CIPI)\n\nMeasures change over time in the general level of prices of inputs in the construction of civil engineering and building projects. The inputs include materials, equipment, labour, transport and fuels among others.\n\n### Consumer Price Index (CPI)\n\nMeasures change over time in the general level of prices of goods and services that households acquire for the purpose of consumption. The basket relates to a selection of goods and services that is representative of the consumption habits of most households in the country.\n\n### Consumption\n\nAny activity in which households use goods and/or services to satisfy their needs and wants but not for business purposes nor for the acquisition of wealth. Thus, investment in all forms of assets is excluded.\n\n### Core Inflation\n\nThis is inflation computed from an index derived from the overall CPI which is intended to show the underlying trend in inflation by excluding price movements arising from transient or volatile product groups.\n\n### Cost of Living Index\n\nIt is an index that measures differences in the price of goods and services, and allows for substitutions to other items as prices change. It measures the change between two periods in the minimum expenditures that would be required to achieve a constant standard of living (that is level of utility or economic well-being).\n\n### Elementary Aggregate\n\nThe lowest level of groups of goods or services for which expenditure weights are assigned and held constant for a fixed period of time. It consists of a relatively homogeneous set of goods and services, with similar characteristics, content, price or price change.\n\n### Export Import Price Index (XMPI)\n\nMeasure the overall change in the price component of transactions in goods and services between the residents of an economic territory and residents of the rest of the world.\n\n### Fixed-Base Index\n\nThis is where the value of every period in a time series is directly related to the same value of one fixed base period.\n\n### Headline Inflation Rate\n\nThis is the total inflation in an economy, for a basket of goods and services, that is, for all items including commodities like food and energy.\n\n### Index Number\n\nAn index number is a statistical measure used to evaluate relative changes in a variable or group of variables, such as price, quantity, or value, over time, across different geographical locations, or according to other characteristics.\n\n### Inflation\n\nInflation is defined as a sustained increase in the general level of prices for goods and services over a period.\n\n### Input Producer Price Index\n\nMeasure of the change in the prices of goods and services bought as intermediate inputs by domestic producers. Covers both domestically produced intermediate inputs and imported intermediate inputs.\n\n### Item\n\nAn individual specified good or service in the sample of products selected for pricing.\n\n### Jevons Price Index\n\nThis is an elementary price index defined as the un-weighted geometric average of the sample price relatives.\n\n### Laspyres Index\n\nA weighted aggregative index showing the ratio of expenditures in the current period (p2q1, where p2 is the current period price and q1 is the base period quantity) to the expenditure in the base period (p1q1, where p1 is the base period price and q1 is the base period quantity) to purchase the identical market basket of items. A laspeyres price index is computed by taking the ratio of the total cost of purchasing a specified group of commodities at current prices to the cost of that same group at base-period prices and multiplying by 100.\n\n### Modified Laspyres Index\n\nIn recent years, there has been a further modification of the Laspeyres formula to suit item replacements in the index basket from time to time due to several reasons, including the smooth substitution of new items and frequent weight updates every month. The modification yields the so-called modified Laspeyres’ formula.\n\n### Monthly Inflation Rate\n\nThe monthly inflation rate is the percentage change in the index (e.g. CPI) of the relevant month compared to the index of the previous month. The monthly inflation rate reflects short-term changes in the average prices.\n\n### Outlet\n\nThis refers to a place where goods and services can be purchased and from where the purchasers’ or list prices of the products sold can be obtained. It may be a shop, a market stall, a catalogue, a website, etc. Also referred to as a “retail outlet”, although it can include wholesale outlets which also sell directly to the consumer.\n\n### Output Producer Price Index\n\nMeasure of the change in the prices of goods and services sold as output by domestic producers. Covers both output sold on the domestic market and output sold as exports. Valuation is at basic prices.\n\n### Price Relative\n\nA price relative is the ratio of the price of a specific product in one period to the price of the same product in some other period.\n\n### Producer Price Index (PPI)\n\nMeasure changes in the prices of domestic produced goods and services. It is a measure of the change in the prices of goods and services either as they leave their place of production or as they enter the production process.\n\n### Products (also referred to as “commodities)\n\nThese are goods and services normally intended for sale on the market at a price that is designed to cover their cost of production.\n\n### Quarterly Inflation Rate\n\nThe quarterly inflation rate is the percentage change in the index (e.g. CPI) of the relevant quarter compared to the index of the previous quarter. The quarterly inflation rate reflects short -term changes in the average prices.\n\n### Representative Product\n\nProduct, or category of products, that accounts for a significant proportion of the total expenditures within an elementary aggregate, and/or for which the average price change is expected to be close to the average for all products within the aggregate, e.g. maize flour may have a larger share than millet flour.\n\n###  Weight\n\nIt is the relative consumption or production share of an item or group of items to the total consumption of households or production. In a CPI context, weight is the total household consumption expenditure on a given elementary aggregate expressed as a share of total consumption expenditure of all elementary aggregates.\n\n###  Weight of a Product/Service in an Index Basket\n\nIt is the proportion of total household expenditure on that product/service during the weight reference period. It depicts the relative importance of goods and services in a basket.\n\n## Science, technology and innovation\n\n### Abandoned innovation activities\n\nInnovation activities of a firm that were abandoned before the implementation of an innovation.\n\n### Acquisition of machinery, equipment, other capital goods, and software\n\nThis innovation activity refers to goods specifically purchased for use in product and process innovation activities of the firm. This includes the acquisition of: land and buildings (including major improvements, modifications and repairs); machinery, instruments and equipment (including computer hardware); and computer software. This category only includes the acquisition of capital goods for innovation that is not included in R&D activities.\n\n###  Acquisition of other external knowledge\n\nThis innovation activity includes the acquisition of rights to use patents and non-patented inventions, licences, disclosures of knowhow, trademarks, designs and patterns from other enterprises and institutions such as universities and government research institutions, other than R&D. Acquisition of external knowledge may also include computer services and other scientific and technical services for product and process innovations activities.\n\n### All manufacturing firms\n\nTotal number of firms in the manufacturing industry.\n\n### Applied research\n\nOriginal investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge. It is, however, directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective.\n\n### Basic research\n\nIt is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundations of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular application or use in view.\n\n### Business enterprise expenditure on R&D (BERD)\n\nRepresents the component of GERD incurred by units belonging to the Business enterprise sector (see the definition of Business enterprise sector). It is the measure of intramural R&D expenditures within the Business enterprise sector during a specific reference period.\n\n### Business enterprise sector (for R&D data)\n\nIn the context of R&D statistics, the business enterprise sector comprises:\n\na.     All resident corporations, including not only legally incorporated enterprises, regardless of the residence of their shareholders. This group includes all other types of quasi-corporations, i.e. units capable of generating a profit or other financial gain for their owners, recognised by law as separate legal entities from their owners, and set up for purposes of engaging in market production at prices that are economically significant.\n\nb.     The unincorporated branches of non-resident enterprises are deemed to be resident because they are engaged in production on the economic territory on a long-term basis.\n\nc.      All resident non-profit institutions (NPIs) that are market producers of goods or services or serve business.\n\nd.     This sector comprises both private and public enterprises.\n\n### Business population\n\nAll firms in the business sector, which can be disaggregated by economic activity and size class.\n\nCapital R&D expenditures are the annual gross amount paid for the acquisition of fixed assets that are used repeatedly or continuously in the performance of R&D for more than one year. They should be reported in full for the period when they took place, whether acquired or developed in house, and should not be registered as an element of depreciation. The most relevant types of assets used for R&D for which capital R&D expenditures should be compiled are:\n\na.   Land and buildings\n\nb.   Machinery and equipment\n\nc.    Capitalised computer software\n\nd.   Other intellectual property products.\n\n### Capitalised computer software (in capital R&D expenditures)\n\nThis includes the costs of computer software that is used in the performance of R&D for more than one year. It includes longterm licences or the acquisition of separately identifiable computer software, including programme descriptions and supporting materials for both systems and applications software. The production costs (e.g. labour and materials) of internally produced software should be reported. Software from external vendors may be obtained through the outright purchase of rights or licences to use. Software used or licensed for one year or less should be reported under current expenditures.\n\n### Contracted-out (external) R&D\n\nAny creative work undertaken to increase the stock of knowledge for developing innovations but performed by other firms (including other firms or subsidiaries within the group) or by public or private research organizations and purchased by the firm.\n\n### Cooperation for innovation activities\n\nActive participation in joint innovation projects with other organizations. Pure contracting out of work, where there is no active collaboration, is not regarded as cooperation.\n\n### Current R&D expenditures\n\nThese are composed of labour costs and other current costs (including for external R&D personnel) used in R&D. Services and items (including equipment) used and consumed within one year are current expenditures. Annual fees or rents for the use of fixed assets should be included in current expenditures.\n\n### Degree of novelty - new to the firm\n\nImplementation by a firm of a new or significantly improved good or service that was already available from its competitors in the market. A product, process, marketing method or organizational method may already have been implemented by other firms, but if it is new to the firm, then it is an innovation for that firm.\n\n### Degree of novelty - new to the market\n\nImplementation of a new or significantly improved good or service by a firm on its market before its competitors. The geographical scope of new to the market is subject to the firm’s own view of its operating market and may include both domestic and international firms.\n\n### Degree of novelty - new to the world\n\nInnovation is new to the world when the firm is the first to implement the innovation for all markets and industries, domestic and international. New to the world therefore implies a qualitatively greater degree of novelty than new to the market.\n\n### Engineering and technology (for R&D data)\n\nEngineering and technology include: civil engineering; electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering; mechanical engineering; chemical engineering; materials engineering; medical engineering; environmental engineering; environmental biotechnology; industrial biotechnology; nano-technology; and other engineering and technologies.\n\n### Exchange funds for R&D\n\nExchange funds for R&D are funding flows from one statistical unit to another statistical unit in return for the performance of R&D and the delivery of relevant R&D outcomes. The unit funding the work incurs a delivery risk associated with the uncertainty of the project. Examples of exchange funds activities include R&D purchases (sales from the perspective of the performer), R&D outsourcing and contributions in the context of collaborative R&D agreements.\n\n### Experimental development\n\nExperimental development is systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience and producing additional knowledge, which is directed to producing new products or processes or to improving existing products or processes.\n\n### External R&D funds\n\nExternal R&D funds are the amount of money spent on R&D that originate outside the control of a reporting unit.\n\n### External R&D personnel\n\nExternal R&D personnel (or contributors) are independent (self-employed) or dependent (employee) workers fully integrated into a statistical unit’s R&D projects without formally being persons employed by the same R&D performing statistical unit.\n\n### Extramural R&D\n\nAny R&D performed outside of the statistical unit about which information is being reported; its “funds for extramural R&D” should include only internal funds (not from external sources) provided to an outside unit for R&D performance including both where there is an expected compensatory delivery of R&D (exchange or purchase) and where no compensatory delivery is expected (transfer or grant). It may also be noted that such funds for extramural R&D often will include payments for costs other than for R&D, such as cost elements covering depreciation costs, performer profit, delivery charges, etc.\n\nFields of research and development (FORD) The fields of research and development (FORD) classification is used to classify R&D units and resources by fields of enquiry, namely, broad knowledge domains based primarily on the content of the R&D subject matter. The main fields of R&D are:\n\na.     Natural sciences\n\nb.     Engineering and technology\n\nc.      Medical and health sciences\n\nd.     Agricultural and veterinary sciences\n\ne.     Social sciences\n\nf.       Humanities and the arts.\n\n### Firms with only abandoned or ongoing innovation activities\n\nFirms that did not implement innovations but had abandoned or ongoing innovation activities to develop them. Unless otherwise specified, the term covers product or process innovation, regardless of organizational or marketing innovation.\n\n### Full-time equivalent (FTE) of R&D personnel \n\nThis is defined as the ratio of working hours actually spent on R&D during a specific reference period (usually a calendar year) divided by the total number of hours conventionally worked in the same period by an individual or by a group. In other words, one full-time equivalent may be thought of as one person-year. Therefore, it is measured by combining two variables: actual involvement in R&D activities and formal engagement on the basis of normative/statutory working hours. FTE is considered to be a true measure of the volume of R&D and also the main R&D personnel statistic for international comparisons.\n\n### GERD as a percentage of GDP \n\nGross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) as a percentage of GDP is the total intramural expenditure on R&D performed in the national territory during a specific reference period expressed as a percentage of GDP of the national territory.\n\n### GERD by fields of research and development\n\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period, broken down by the fields of research and development. The fields included are:\n\na.    Natural sciences\n\nb.    Engineering and technology\n\nc.    Medical and health sciences\n\nd.    Agricultural and veterinary sciences\n\ne.     Social sciences\n\nf.      Humanities and the arts.\n\n### GERD by sector of performance\n\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period, broken down by the institutions corresponding to eac h sector (business enterprise, government, higher education and private non-profit organizations), independent of the source of funds.\n\n### GERD by source of funds\n\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period, broken down by current costs (labour costs and other current costs) and capital expenditure (land and buildings, machinery and equipment, capitalised computer software and other intellectual property products).\n\n### GERD by type of R&D activity\n\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period, broken down by basic research, applied research and experimental development.\n\n### GERD in local currency\n\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period and reported in current national currency (i.e. expenditure at current prices in national currency).\n\n### GERD in Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs)\n\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period, expressed in Purchasing Power Parity dollars.\n\n### GERD per capita\n\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period per inhabitant.\n\n### GERD per researcher\n\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period per researcher.\n\n### Government budget allocations for R&D (GBARD)\n\nIt encompasses all spending allocations met from sources of government revenue foreseen within the budget, such as taxation. Spending allocations by extra-budgetary government entities are only within the scope to the extent that their funds are allocated through the budgetary process. Likewise, R&D financing by public corporations is outside the scope of GBARD statistics, as it is based on funds raised within the market and outside the budgetary process. Only in the exceptional case of budgetary provisions for R&D to be carried out or distributed from public corporations should this be counted as part of GBARD.\n\n### Government expenditure on R&D (GOVERD)\n\nIt represents the component of GERD incurred by units belonging to the Government sector (see the definition of Government sector). It is the measure of expenditures on intramural R&D within the Government sector during a specific reference period.\n\nGovernment sector (for R&D data) In the context of R&D statistics, the Government sector consists of the following groups of resident institutional units\n\na.     All units of central (federal), regional (state) or local (municipal) government, including social security funds, except those units that provide higher education services or fit the description of higher education institutions (see the definition of Higher education sector).\n\nb.     All non-market NPIs that are controlled by government units that are not part of the Higher education sector.\n\nc.      This sector does not include public corporations, even when all the equity of such corporations is owned by government units. Public enterprises are included in the Business enterprise sector.\n\n### Government tax relief for R&D expenditures (GTARD)\n\nIt describes tax relief provisions that apply to taxpayers strictly as a result of their engagement in R&D performance and/or funding activities, relative to a normal or baseline tax structure.\n\n### Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) \n\nIt is total intramural expenditure on R&D performed in the national territory during a specific reference period.\n\n### Gross national expenditure on R&D (GNERD)\n\nIt comprises total expenditure on R&D financed by a country’s institutions regardless of where the R&D is performed. As such, it includes R&D performed in the “rest of the world” that is financed by national institutions or residents; it excludes R&D performed within a country that is funded from institutions outside of the national territory (that is, from institutions that are part of the “rest of the world”). GNERD is constructed by adding the domestically financed intramural expenditures of each performing sector plus the R&D performed in the “rest of the world” that is financed by domestic funding sectors.\n\n### Grossed up results\n\nResults of the survey extrapolated to the whole target population. Sample survey data represent units in the sample only. Therefore, the sample estimates need to be inflated to represent the whole population of interest. Estimation is the means by which this inflation occurs, also referred to as “grossing up”. Hampering factors for innovation activities Innovation activity may be hampered by a number of factors. There may be reasons for not starting innovation activities at all; there may be factors that slow innovation activities or affect them negatively. These hampering factors include: economic factors, such as high costs or lack of demand; enterprise factors, such as lack of skilled personnel or knowledge; and legal factors, such as regulations or tax rules. Two indicators are calculated:\n\na.     the percentage of innovation-active firms for which hampering factors were highly important and\n\nb.     the percentage of non-innovative firms for which hampering factors were highly important.\n\n### Headcount (HC) of R&D personnel \n\nThe total number of individuals contributing to intramural R&D, at the level of a statistical unit or at an aggregate level, during a specific reference period (usually a calendar year). That means headcount data reflect the total number of persons who are mainly or partially employed in R&D. The use of HCs is mostly recommended in terms of exploring, usually in percentage terms, the characteristics of R&D personnel.\n\n### Higher education expenditure on R&D (HERD)\n\nRepresents the component of GERD incurred by units belonging to the Higher education sector (see the definition of Higher education sector). It is the measure of intramural R&D expenditures within the Higher education sector during a specific period.\n\nHigher education sector (for R&D data) In the context of R&D statistics, the Higher education sector comprises:\n\na.     All universities, colleges of technology and other institutions providing formal tertiary education programmes (i.e. ISCED levels 5, 6, 7, or 8), whatever their source of finance or legal status.\n\nb.     All research institutes, centres, experimental stations and clinics that have their R&D activities under the direct control of, or are administered by, tertiary education institutions.\n\n### Humanities and the arts (for R&D data)\n\nHumanities and the arts include: history and archaeology; languages and literature; philosophy, ethics and religion; art (arts, history of arts, performing arts, music); and other humanities.\n\n### In-house R&D\n\nAny creative work undertaken within the firm to increase the stock of knowledge for developing innovations (see the Frascati Manual).\n\n### Innovation\n\nImplementation of a new or significantly improved product (good or service), or process, or a new marketing method, or a new organizational method. The minimum requirement for an innovation is that the product, process, marketing method or organizational method must be new (or significantly improved in the case of product or process) to the firm.\n\n### Innovation activities\n\nAll scientific, technological, organizational, financial, and commercial steps which actually lead, or are intended to lead, to the implementation of innovations. Some innovation activities are themselves innovative, others are not novel activities but are necessary for the implementation of innovations. Innovation activities also include R&D that is not directly related to the development of a specific innovation. The indicator is calculated as a percentage.\n\n### Innovation-active firms\n\nFirms that have had innovation activities during the observation period of the innovation survey, including those with ongoing and abandoned activities. In other words, firms that have had innovation activities during the observation period, regardless of whether the activity resulted in the implementation of an innovation, are innovation-active. Unless otherwise specified, the term covers product or process innovation, regardless of organizational or marketing innovation. The indicator is calculated as a percentage.\n\n### Innovative firms\n\nAre firms that implemented an innovation. Unless otherwise specified, the term is used to refer to product or process innovative firms, which are also known as product or process innovators. The indicator is calculated as a percentage.\n\n### Internal R&D funds\n\nThe amount of money spent on R&D that originate within the control of and are used for R&D at the discretion of a reporting statistical unit. Internal R&D funds do not include R&D funds received from other statistical units explicitly for intramural R&D.\n\n### Internal R&D personnel\n\nPersons employed by the statistical unit who contribute to the unit’s intramural R&D activities.\n\n### Intramural R&D expenditures\n\nAll current expenditures plus gross fixed capital expenditures for R&D performed within a statistical unit during a specific reference period, whatever the source of funds. Intramural R&D expenditure is synonymous with the performance of R&D within a statistical unit. The aggregation of intramural R&D for all units within a sector is synonymous with the performance of R&D within a sector of the economy; the summation of intramural R&D for all sectors is synonymous with the performance of R&D for the entire economy (GERD).\n\n### Labour costs (in current R&D expenditures)\n\nLabour costs, or compensation of employed personnel, comprise annual wages and salaries and all associated costs or fringe benefits, such as bonus payments, stock options, holiday pay, contributions to pension funds. The concept of labour costs also includes other social security payments and payroll taxes.\n\n### Land and buildings (in capital R&D expenditures)\n\nInclude land acquired for R&D use (e.g. testing grounds, sites for laboratories and pilot plants) and buildings constructed or purchased for R&D use, including major improvements, modifications and repairs.\n\n### Level of formal qualification (for R&D data)\n\nThe International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) provides the basis for classifying R&D personnel by formal qualification. Five classes are recommended for the purposes of R&D statistics. They are defined exclusively by level of education, regardless of the field in which personnel are qualified.\n\na.     Doctoral or equivalent level: Programmes at ISCED level 8, or doctoral or equivalent level, are designed primarily to lead to an advanced research qualification. Programmes at this level are devoted to advanced study and original research and are typically offered only by research-oriented tertiary educational institutions such as universities. Doctoral programmes exist in both academic and professional fields.\n\nb.     Master’s or equivalent level: Programmes at level, or Master’s or equivalent level, are often designed to provide participants with advanced academic and/or professional knowledge, skills and competencies, leading to a second degree or equivalent qualification. Programmes at this level may have a substantial research component but do not yet lead to the award of a doctoral qualification. Typically, programmes at this level are theoretically-based but may include practical components and are informed by state of the art research and/or best professional practice. They are traditionally offered by universities and other tertiary educational institutions.\n\nc.      Bachelor’s or equivalent level: Programmes level, Bachelor’s or equivalent level, are often designed to provide participants with intermediate academic and/or professional knowledge, skills and competencies, leading to a first degree or equivalent qualification. Programmes at this level are typically theoretically-based but may include practical components and are informed by state of the art research and/or best professional practice. They are traditionally offered by universities and equivalent tertiary educational institutions. First degree programmes at this level typically have a duration of three to four years of full-time study at the tertiary level.\n\nd.     Short-cycle tertiary education: Programmes at level, or short-cycle tertiary education, are often designed to provide participants with professional knowledge, skills and competencies. Typically, they are practically based, occupationally-specific and prepare students to enter the labour market. However, these programmes may also provide a pathway to other tertiary education programmes.\n\ne.     This includes post-secondary non-tertiary education, upper secondary education and below. Post-secondary non-tertiary education: Post-secondary non-tertiary education provides learning and educational activities building on secondary education preparing for both labour market entry as well as tertiary education. It typically targets students who have completed upper secondary but who want to increase their opportunities either to enter the labour market or to progress to tertiary education. Programmes are often not significantly more advanced than those at upper secondary as they typically serve to broaden rather than deepen knowledge, skills and competencies. It therefore aims at learning below the high level of complexity characteristic of tertiary education. Upper secondary education: Programmes at this level, or ‘upper secondary’ education, are typically designed to complete secondary education in preparation for tertiary education, or to provide skills relevant to employment, or both. Programmes at this level offer students more varied, specialised and in-depth instruction than programmes at lower secondary education. They are more differentiated, with an increased range of options and streams available.\n\n### Machinery and equipment (in capital R&D expenditures)\n\nCover major (i.e. capitalised) machinery and equipment acquired for use in the performance of R&D.\n\n### Market introduction of innovations\n\nActivities for the market introduction of product innovations, including market research, market tests and launch advertising.\n\n### Marketing innovation\n\nImplementation of a new marketing method involving significant changes in product design or packaging, product placement, product promotion or pricing.\n\n### Marketing innovators\n\nFirms that implemented marketing innovation.\n\n### Medical and health sciences (for R&D data)\n\nMedical and health sciences include: basic medicine; clinical medicine; health sciences; medical biotechnology; and other medical sciences.\n\n### Natural sciences (for R&D data)\n\nInclude: mathematics; computer and information sciences; physical sciences; chemical sciences; earth and related environmental sciences; biological sciences; and other natural sciences.\n\n### Natural sciences and engineering (for R&D data)\n\nNatural sciences and engineering include:\n\na.       Natural sciences: mathematics; computer and information sciences; physical sciences; chemical sciences; earth and related environmental sciences; biological sciences; other natural sciences;\n\nb.       Engineering and technology: civil engineering; electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering; mechanical engineering; chemical engineering; materials engineering; medical engineering; environmental engineering; environmental biotechnology; industrial biotechnology; nano-technology; and other engineering and technologies;\n\nc.        Medical and health sciences: basic medicine; clinical medicine; health sciences; medical biotechnology; and other medical sciences;\n\nd.       Agricultural and veterinary sciences: agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; animal and dairy science; veterinary science; agricultural biotechnology; and other agricultural sciences.\n\n### Non-innovative firms\n\nFirms without any kind of innovation activity.

Other intangibles that can be reported in a unit’s internal financial accounts, such as marketing assets or goodwill, should not be included.\n\n### Other preparations for product and process innovations\n\nThis includes other internal activities related to the development and implementation of product and process innovations that are not included in R&D. They include development activities that are either partially excluded as R&D (such as industrial design, engineering and set-up, and trial production) or fully excluded (such as patent and licence work, production start-up, and testing), and development activities for product or process innovations that do not meet the novelty requirement for R&D (i.e., they are new to the firm but not new to the market).\n\n### Other supporting staff\n\nThis includes skilled and unskilled craftsmen, and administrative, secretarial and clerical staff participating in R&D projects or directly associated with such projects.\n\n### Other supporting staff by sector of employment\n\nSkilled and unskilled craftsmen, and administrative, secretarial and clerical staff participating in R&D projects or directly associated with such projects, broken down by the sectors they are employed in (business enterprise, government, higher education and private non-profit organizations).\n\n### Performers of R&D\n\nThis consists of statistical units that undertake (i.e. perform) R&D in each of the main sectors covered: Business enterprise, Government, Higher education and Private non-profit.\n\n### Preparations for marketing innovations\n\nActivities related to the development and implementation of new marketing methods not previously used by a firm. They include the development and planning of new marketing methods and the work involved in their implementation. Activities related to marketing innovations include only those for developing and implementing new marketing methods, not expenditures for using these methods in daily business. This category also includes the acquisition of other external knowledge of machinery, equipment, and other capital goods and training that are specifically related to marketing innovations.\n\n### Preparations for organizational innovations\n\nActivities related to the development and planning of new organizational methods and the work involved in their implementation. This category also includes the acquisition of other external knowledge of machinery, equipment and other capital goods and training activities that are specifically related to organizational innovations.\n\n### Private non-profit expenditure on R&D (PNPERD)\n\nThus represents the component of GERD incurred by units belonging to the Private non-profit sector (see the definition of Private non-profit sector).

This means that a given sum of money, when converted into US dollars at the PPP exchange rate (PPP dollars), will buy the same basket of goods and services in all countries. In other words, PPP is the rate of currency conversion which eliminates the differences in price levels among countries. Thus, comparisons between countries reflect only differences in the volume of goods and services purchased.\n\n### R&D coefficients\n\nThis is a tool for calculating / estimating the shares of personnel and expenditure data attributable to R&D. They are especially used for distributing total resources among research, teaching and other activities (including administration) in the Higher education sector. They can be used for the total expenditure or for parts of it, like public general university funds (GUF) or for personnel only.\n\nR&D functions classification of personnel d according to their R&D function, which may be researcher, technician or other support staff.\n\n### R&D personnel by sex \n\nThese are researchers, technicians and equivalent staff, and other supporting staff, broken down by sex (male and female).\n\n### Research and experimental development (R&D)\n\nThe creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge including knowledge of humankind, culture and society – and to devise new applications of available knowledge. The term R&D covers three types of activity: basic research, applied research and experimental development. For an activity to be an R&D activity, it must satisfy five core criteria. The activity must be:\n\na.   Novel (to be aimed at new findings)\n\nb.   Creative (to be based on original, not obvious, concepts and hypotheses)\n\nc.    Uncertain (to be uncertain about the final outcome)\n\nd.   Systematic (to be planned and budgeted)\n\ne.   Transferable and/or reproducible (to lead to results that could be possibly reproduced).\n\n### Researchers\n\nThese are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge. They conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods.\n\n### Researchers by age\n\nThese are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) broken down by age. The age groups recommended are: under 25 years, 25-34 years, 35-44 years, 45-54 years, 55-64 years, and 65 years and more.\n\n### Researchers by fields of research and development\n\nThese are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) broken down by fields of research and development.\n\nThe fields included are:\n\na.    Natural sciences\n\nb.    Engineering and technology\n\nc.    Medical and health sciences\n\nd.    Agricultural and veterinary sciences\n\ne.    Social sciences\n\nf.     Humanities and the arts.\n\n### Researchers by formal qualification professionals\n\nEngaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) broken down by their formal level of qualification.\n\n### Researchers by sector of employment professionals\n\nEngaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) broken down by the sectors they are employed in (business enterprise, government, higher education and private non-profit organizations).\n\n### Researchers by seniority level professionals\n\nEngaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) broken down by the seniority levels. It is proposed to use the following classification of seniority grades/levels:\n\na.   Category A: The single highest grade/post at which research is normally conducted. Example: “Director of research” or “Full professor”.\n\nb.   Category B: Researchers working in positions not as senior as top position (A) but more senior than newly qualified doctoral graduates. Example: “Senior researcher” or “Principal investigator” or “Associate professor”.\n\nc.    Category C: The first grade/post into which a newly qualified doctoral graduate would normally be recruited. Examples: “Researcher” or “Investigator” or “Assistant professor” or “Post-doctoral fellow”.\n\nd.   Category D: Either doctoral students who are engaged as researchers, or researchers working in posts that do not normally require a doctorate degree. Examples: “Ph.D. students” or “Junior researchers” (without a Ph.D.). Master’s students who are counted as researchers would also fall under this category.\"\n\n### Researchers per million inhabitants\n\nThe number of professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) during a given year expressed as a proportion of a population of one million.\n\n### Researchers per thousand employment\n\nThe number of professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) during a given year expressed as a proportion of 1,000 employed people.\n\n### Researchers per thousand labour force\n\nThe number of professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) during a given year expressed as a proportion of a labour force of 1,000 people.\n\n### Rest of the world (for R&D data)\n\nIn the context of R&D statistics, the rest of the world (formerly referred to as ‘Abroad’) includes:\n\na.   All institutions and individuals without a location, place of production or premises within the economic territory on which or from which the unit engages and intends to continue engaging, either indefinitely or over a finite but long period of time, in economic activities and transactions on a significant scale;\n\nb.   All international organisations and supranational entities including facilities and operations within the country’s borders.\n\n### Social sciences (for R&D data)\n\nThis includes psychology and cognitive sciences; economics and business; education; sociology; law; political science; social and economic geography; media and communications; and other social sciences.\n\n### Social sciences and humanities (for R&D data)\n\nThese include social sciences: psychology and cognitive sciences; economics and business; education; sociology; law; political science; social and economic geography; media and communications; other social sciences; and- Humanities and the arts: history and archaeology; languages and literature; philosophy, ethics and religion; art (arts, history of arts, performing arts, music); and other humanities.\n\n### Source of R&D funds \n\nThis is the unit that provides the funds for R&D performance.

They provide access to knowledge without the need to pay for the knowledge itself, although there may be marginal fees for access (membership in trade associations, attendance at conferences, subscriptions to journals). Open information sources do not provide access to knowledge embodied in machinery or equipment or the right to use knowledge protected by patents and other forms of intellectual property, although the knowledge behind the patent can be accessed through patent databases. Some open sources, such as attendance at fairs or exhibitions, can give access to some tacit knowledge through personal interaction with other participants.\n\n### Successful innovation activities\n\nThese are activities of a firm that resulted in the implementation of an innovation (though not necessarily commercially successful).\n\n### Technicians and equivalent staff \n\nThese are persons whose main tasks require technical knowledge and experience in one or more fields of engineering, the physical and life sciences, or the social sciences, humanities and the arts. They participate in R&D by performing scientific and technical tasks involving the application of concepts, operational methods and the use of research equipment, normally under the supervision of researchers.\n\n### Time-use surveys (for R&D data)\n\nThis is a statistical survey that aims to report data on how people spend their time. If the necessary R&D coefficients cannot be derived from other surveys or administrative data, time-use surveys are the recommended method to derive the necessary information for estimating the R&D component of full-time equivalents (FTEs) and expenditures.\n\n### Total R&D personnel\n\nin a statistical unit, these include all persons engaged directly in R&D, whether employed by the statistical unit or external contributors fully integrated into the statistical unit’s R&D activities, as well as those providing direct services for the R&D activities (such as R&D managers, administrators, technicians and clerical staff). Persons providing indirect support and ancillary services, such as canteen, maintenance, administrative and security staff, should be excluded, even though their wages and salaries are included as an overhead cost when measuring R&D expenditure. Two main groups of individuals who potentially contribute to the R&D activities can be identified in a statistical unit: ‘Internal R&D personnel’ and ‘external R&D personnel’. Both groups of R&D personnel are classified according to their R&D function: ‘Researchers’, ‘technicians’ and ‘other supporting staff’. (See the relevant definitions in this glossary).\n\n### Training for innovative activities\n\nThese are all the training (including external training) that is required for the development or implementation of product or process innovations.\n\n### Transfer R&D funds \n\nThese are funding flows from one statistical unit to another statistical unit to perform R&D that does not require any good or service in return and where the funder is not entitled to any significant rights on the outcome of the R&D it has funded. The unit that provides transfer funds for R&D may impose some conditions on the performer, such as periodic reporting, compliance with the activity or project description as agreed in the terms of the agreement, or even public dissemination of research outcomes. Examples of transfer funds include grants, debt forgiveness, philanthropy, crowd-funding and personal transfers such as gifts and GUF (by convention for international comparisons). To be included as R&D transfer funds, the funds should be intended by the originating source to be used for R&D. Normally, the R&D performer will retain most rights to the outcomes of the R&D, which explains the transfer nature of this R&D funding transaction.\n\n### Types of costs of R&D\n\nInclude individual current and capital cost categories for intramural R&D. Types of current costs include labour costs for internal R&D personnel and other current costs (for external R&D personnel, purchases of services, purchases of materials, and other costs not elsewhere classified. Types of capital costs include land and buildings, machinery and equipment, capitalised computer software and other intellectual property products.\n\n### Types of R&D\n\nThree types of R&D are considered under the term ‘R&D’: basic research, applied research and experimental development.\n\n### Types of R&D funds\n\nThese are the funds to cover the costs of R&D involving significant flows between units, sectors and countries. From the perspective of performance, R&D is conducted by the statistical unit with funds either from the statistical unit’s own sources (internal) or from sources outside of the statistical unit (external). From the perspective of funding, R&D funds pay for either the costs of R&D performance within the statistical unit (intramural) or the costs of R&D performance outside of the statistical unit (extramural). There can be a flow of R&D funds between statistical units either with (exchange) or without (transfer) compensatory return flows of R&D from the performer. See the relevant definitions (on ‘internal’ and ‘external’ sources of R&D funds, ‘intramural’ and ‘extramural’ R&D, and ‘exchange’ and ‘transfer’ categories of funds for R&D) in this glossary.\n\n## Economic statistics, n.e.c.\n\n# Environment Statistics\n\n## Environmental Conditions and Quality\n\nEnvironmental conditions and quality refer to the physical, chemical, biological, and socio-economic factors that characterize the environment and determine its ability to sustain life.

Gender equality ensures that individuals can realize their full potential without discrimination based on gender.\n\n### Gender Indicators\n\nMeasures used to assess progress toward gender equality. These may be quantitative (e.g., statistics, figures) or qualitative (e.g., perceptions, experiences).\n\n### Gender Equity\n\nThe principle of fairness in treatment for women and men, accounting for different needs, interests, and experiences. It may require special measures to address historic or systemic disadvantages.\n\n### Gender Gap\n\nThe measurable difference between women and men in terms of access to opportunities, resources, and participation in various sectors.\n\n### Gender Disparities\n\nStatistical differences, often called gaps, between men and women that reflect unequal conditions or outcomes.\n\n### Gender Parity\n\nGender parity is a numerical measure that reflects relative equality in terms of the number and proportion of women and men, or girls and boys. It is commonly calculated as the ratio of female to male values for a given indicator. When the ratio is calculated as male to female instead, the term “sex ratio” is used rather than “gender parity.”\n\n### Gender Parity Index\n\nThe Gender Parity Index (GPI) measures the relative access to education of female and male students. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of females to the number of males enrolled at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of education.\n\n### Gender Development Index (GDI)\n\nThe GDI is a tool used to measure gender inequalities in the social, cultural, economic, and political spheres. It assesses gender gaps in human development across three key dimensions:\n\n1.       Health – measured by female and male life expectancy at birth;\n\n2.     Education – measured by female and male expected years of schooling for children and mean years of schooling for adults aged 25 and above;\n\n3.      Economic resources – measured by estimated earned income for females and males.\n\n### Gender Blindness\n\nGender blindness refers to the failure to recognize that the roles and responsibilities of women/girls and men/boys are socially and culturally constructed. Gender-blind studies, programs, projects, policies, and attitudes maintain the status quo, overlooking diverse needs and roles, and therefore fail to transform unequal gender relations.\n\n### Gender Roles\n\nGender roles are social and behavioral norms that a given culture considers appropriate for individuals of a specific sex. These roles often determine traditional tasks and responsibilities assigned to women, men, boys, and girls, and are shaped by factors such as household structure, access to resources, the global economy, conflict, disasters, and local ecological conditions.\n\n### Gender Norms\n\nGender norms are the accepted attributes and behaviors associated with male and female identities in a specific society or community at a particular point in time. They establish standards and expectations of how men and women should act. Internalized early in life, gender norms influence lifelong gender socialization and stereotypes.\n\n### Gender Planning\n\nGender planning is an approach that acknowledges the different roles of women and men in society and recognizes that their needs often differ.\n\n### Strategic Gender Needs\n\nThese are the requirements necessary for women and men to improve their status or position in society. Addressing strategic gender needs enables individuals to move beyond restrictive social roles. For women, these needs may include land rights, decision-making power, equal pay, and access to credit.\n\n### Gender Relations\n\nGender relations are a specific subset of social relations that define interactions between men and women as social groups. These relations intersect with other social influences—such as age, ethnicity, race, and religion—to shape individuals’ status and identity. As social constructs, gender relations can be changed.\n\n### Gender Balance\n\nGender balance refers to equal participation of women and men in all areas of work and within programs initiated or supported by institutions. Achieving gender balance creates a more inclusive environment, enhances policy and program effectiveness, and strengthens institutional capacity to serve the entire population.\n\n### Gender Accommodating\n\nIt’s the awareness of gender differences and the willingness to adjust and adapt policies, programs, or actions accordingly. It is closely related to gender sensitivity.\n\n### Gender Perspective\n\nTaking a gender perspective involves considering gender-based differences in any social phenomenon, policy, or process. It emphasizes differences in status and power and examines how gender-based discrimination shapes both immediate needs and long-term interests. In policymaking, a gender perspective ensures that women’s and men’s experiences are equally considered in the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of programs and policies.\n\n### Gender Mainstreaming\n\nGender mainstreaming is the systematic integration of a gender perspective into the preparation, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of policies, regulations, and spending programs, with the aim of promoting gender equality and eliminating discrimination.\n\n### Gender Mainstreaming in Statistics\n\nThis involves the systematic consideration of gender issues and the elimination of gender-based bias throughout all stages of statistical production.\n\n### Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)\n\nAll procedures involving the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.\n\n### Domestic Violence\n\nAll acts of physical, sexual, psychological, or economic violence occurring within the family or domestic setting. This applies regardless of biological or legal ties and includes violence between current or former spouses or partners, whether or not they share a residence.\n\n### Gender-Based Violence (GBV)\n\nAn umbrella term for any harmful act perpetrated against a person based on socially ascribed gender differences. GBV varies across cultures and regions and includes sexual violence, domestic violence, trafficking, forced or early marriage, harmful traditional practices (e.g., FGM, honor killings, widow inheritance), and more. These acts may occur in both public and private settings.\n\n### Women’s Issues\n\nThese refer to the unique opportunities, challenges, and constraints that affect women and girls. Due to inadequate representation at decision-making levels, their needs are often overlooked or inadequately addressed.\n\n### Women in Development (WID)\n\nThe WID approach highlights the marginalization of women in development processes. It advocates for the inclusion of women in development initiatives to ensure that they benefit equally from resources and interventions.\n\n### Empowerment\n\nRefers to enhancing the personal, political, social, or economic strength of individuals and communities. Women's empowerment enables them to gain control over their lives through increased awareness, confidence, choice, access to resources, and transformation of discriminatory structures and institutions.\n\n### Women’s Economic Empowerment\n\nRefers to enabling women to participate equally in and benefit from decent work, social protection, market access, and control over resources, time, and decision-making. It also involves increasing women's voice, agency, and participation in economic decisions at all levels, from the household to international institutions.\n\n## Special Population Groups\n\n### Person with Disability\n\nA person with a disability is someone who has a long-term physical, psychological, intellectual, or sensory impairment which, in interaction with various barriers, may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.\n\n### Disability Cash Benefits\n\nDisability cash benefits refer to financial payments made to individuals who are fully or partially unable to engage in gainful employment due to a disability. The disability may be congenital or acquired as a result of an accident or illness during the individual’s lifetime. These benefits do not include those resulting from prescribed industrial accidents or occupational diseases, which are classified under occupational injury and disease. The provision of goods and services in kind is categorized under services for the elderly and persons with disabilities.\n\n### Stateless Persons\n\nStateless persons are individuals who are not recognized as nationals by any state under the operation of its laws; either because they never acquired a nationality or because they lost it without obtaining a new one.\n\n### Stateless Population, *In Situ*\n\nThis refers to stateless individuals who have never crossed an international border but remain in their “own country”- a place where they have long-standing and significant ties, usually through birth or long-term residence. Their statelessness is often the result of shortcomings in the design or implementation of nationality laws.\n\n### Indigenous Peoples\n\nIndigenous peoples are communities, groups, or individuals who are descended from the original inhabitants of a country or region, and who retain distinct social, cultural, economic, and political characteristics. They often maintain their own languages, traditions, customs, and institutions and have a strong connection to ancestral lands and natural resources. Indigenous peoples typically identify themselves as such and are recognized by others as belonging to distinct cultural groups. Despite their diversity, they frequently face challenges related to marginalization, land rights, and preservation of cultural heritage.\n\n### Guardian\n\nA guardian is an independent adult who safeguards a child’s best interests and general well-being and complements the child’s limited legal capacity.\n\n### Unaccompanied Child\n\nAn unaccompanied child is one who has been separated from both parents and other relatives and is not being cared for by an adult who, by law or custom, is responsible for doing so.\n\n### Alternative Care (Child Protection)\n\nAlternative care refers to arrangements made for children who are temporarily or permanently deprived of their family environment or whose best interests require placement outside their family.\n\n### Best Interests of the Child Principle\n\nAs stated in Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC): “In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.”\n\n### Justice for Children\n\nJustice for children refers to a United Nations framework and set of guiding principles aimed at ensuring that justice systems better serve and protect children. It promotes full adherence to international norms and standards for all children who come into contact with justice or related systems, whether as victims, witnesses, alleged offenders, or for matters involving care, custody, or protection.\n\n### Juvenile Justice\n\nJuvenile justice is a justice system designed specifically for children or young persons who are considered juveniles under the respective legal system. It ensures that offenses committed by juveniles are addressed in a manner distinct from how adult offenses are treated. Age limits defining juveniles vary by country.\n\n### Older Person\n\nAccording to the United Nations, an older person is someone aged 60 years or older. However, in many communities, age is also determined by socio-cultural markers such as family status (e.g., being a grandparent), physical appearance (e.g., grey hair, wrinkles), or age-related health conditions.\n\n### Youth\n\nThere is no universally agreed international definition of “youth.” For statistical purposes, however, the United Nations defines youth as individuals between the ages of 15 and 24 years, without prejudice to definitions adopted by individual Member States.\n\n### Person of Concern\n\nThis term traditionally refers to all individuals for whom the UNHCR is mandated to provide protection, assistance, and durable solutions. It includes refugees, asylum-seekers, refugee returnees, stateless persons, and—in many situations—internally displaced persons (IDPs), including those supported by State and non-State partners.\n\n## Living Conditions and Poverty\n\nLiving conditions are the circumstances or factors affecting the way in which people live, particularly with regard to their well-being. The term 'living conditions' is closely related to that of 'quality of life.\n\nPoverty is a state or condition in which an individual lacks the financial resources and essentials for a basic standard of living.\n\n### Welfare Analysis\n\nWelfare analysis, in economics, is the study of how policies or market changes affect the well-being of individuals and society, primarily by measuring the net benefits to consumers and producers.\n\n### Poverty\n\nPoverty is a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, such as food, clean water, shelter, education, and healthcare (monetary and non-monetary). It typically results from a lack of access to resources or opportunities to improve one's economic situation. Poverty is often measured by income levels, with individuals or households falling below a certain income threshold considered to be in poverty. However, poverty also encompasses other dimensions, including social exclusion, lack of access to essential services, and limited opportunities for economic and social advancement.\n\n### Household Expenditure\n\nHousehold expenditure refers to the total spending by a person living alone or a group of people living together on goods and services within a specific time period.\n\n### Household Consumption\n\nHousehold consumption is the quantity of goods and services that the household enjoys in a given period.\n\n### Household Consumption Expenditure\n\nHousehold consumption expenditure includes those money outlays directed toward consumption (e.g., it excludes outlays for investment purposes).\n\n### Data Used in Analysis\n\nData used in analysis refers to the specific information, collected and prepared, that is subjected to various techniques and methods to extract meaningful insights, support decision-making, and draw conclusions. It encompasses raw data that has been organized, cleaned, and potentially transformed to make it suitable for analysis.\n\n### Recall Period\n\nThe recall period in an interview refers to the specific timeframe that respondents are asked to remember or reflect upon when providing information. It is a key aspect in survey design, especially in interviews related to data collection on behaviors, expenditures, or experiences.\n\nIn an interview about household income, the recall period might be \"the last month\" or \"the past year,\" and respondents would be asked to report their income or expenditures during that specific period. The choice of recall period is important because it affects the accuracy and reliability of the responses. If the recall period is too long, respondents may forget details or provide inaccurate information. If it is too short, the information might not capture enough relevant data to make meaningful conclusions.\n\n### -Day Recall Period\n\nRecall interviews with a 7-day recall period are used for the collection of food consumption data, as this method provides a good balance between accuracy and cost-effectiveness.\n\n### 1-Month Recall Period\n\nRecall interviews with a 1-month recall period are used for the collection of frequent non-food consumption data.\n\n### 6-Month Recall Period\n\nRecall interviews with a 6-month recall period are used for the collection of less frequent non-food consumption data.\n\n### 1-Year Recall Period\n\nRecall interviews with a 1-year recall period are used for the collection of durable goods consumption data.\n\n### Nominal Consumption Aggregate (NCA)\n\nThe computation of a consumption-based welfare measure consists of assembling the so-called nominal consumption aggregate (NCA) from survey data. NCA is defined as the value of all goods and services consumed by members of the household during the reference period (see Household Consumption Expenditure).\n\n### Modes of Acquisition\n\nAll surveys should collect data on all main modes of food acquisition, namely:\\\n a) Purchases;\\\n b) Household’s own production; and\\\n c) Received in kind/gifts, etc.\n\n### Household’s Own Production\n\nFood from own production includes products usually sold as part of a household’s main commercial enterprise that are instead reserved for consumption (farm households are a typical example), as well as non-commercial and subsistence food production, and food acquired from hunting, fishing, and gathering.\n\n### Food Received in Kind\n\nFood received in kind in the form of transfers from other households, the private sector, or the government.\n\n### Food Away from Home\n\n“Food away from home” generally refers to food prepared away from home, regardless of whether the food is consumed outside or inside the home. This includes meals and snacks purchased from restaurants and other commercial establishments (including takeout meals), received in-kind at school, at work, from other households, etc.\n\n### Non-Food Non-Durable Items\n\nThe non-food non-durable items of the non-food component of the NCA will include all the items in Division 03 “Clothing and Footwear” through to Category 13 “Personal Care, Social Protection, and Miscellaneous Goods,” referencing the Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP), the international reference classification of household expenditures (United Nations, 2018).\n\n### Durable Goods (Items)\n\nThe durable goods/items of the non-food component of the NCA include those defined by their durability—meaning their ability to deliver useful services through repeated use over an extended period. Examples include automobiles, household appliances, and electronic devices.\n\n### Hedonic Rent Imputation – Housing Component of the NCA\n\nHedonic rent imputation is a method used in economic analysis to estimate the value of housing or real estate, accounting for attributes that influence price, such as location, size, amenities, and condition. The “hedonic pricing model” assumes the price of a good (in this case, housing) is determined by the sum of the values of its individual characteristics.\n\n### Adjusting for Price Variation\n\nAdjusting for price variation refers to accounting for differences in prices over time or across locations when comparing economic data, such as income, expenditure, or living standards. This adjustment—using either Paasche or Laspeyres price deflators—eliminates the influence of price changes or regional disparities to enable like-for-like comparisons.\n\n### Adjusting for Household Size and Composition\n\nThis refers to modifying economic indicators (such as income or expenditure) to account for differences in the number and characteristics of household members (e.g., age, gender) using equivalence scales or consumption needs.\n\n### Poverty Profile\n\nA description of how the extent of poverty varies across sub-groups of a given population, characterized by gender, geographical location, type of economic activity, income source, etc.\n\n### Poverty Line\n\nThe poverty line is a monetary threshold determined at a specific time and location, representing the minimum level of income or consumption expenditure required to meet basic needs, including food, housing, clothing, and healthcare.\n\n### The Food Poverty Line\n\nThe food poverty line represents the minimum monetary threshold in Kenyan Shillings required to meet nutritional needs based on consumption patterns. It is calculated based on food that provides 2,250 Kcal per adult equivalent per day, over a 30-day period.\n\n### Absolute Poverty/Overall Poverty Line\n\nThe monetary threshold in Kenyan Shillings required to purchase a combination of food and non-food items per adult equivalent per month.\n\n### Food Poverty\n\nIndividuals (or households, if estimated at the household level) whose food consumption per adult equivalent falls below the food poverty line in rural or urban areas are considered food poor or in \"food poverty.\"\n\n### Overall (Absolute) Poverty\n\nIndividuals (or households) whose total (food and non-food) consumption per adult equivalent falls below the overall poverty line are considered in \"overall poverty.\"\n\n### Hardcore (Extreme) Poverty\n\nIndividuals (or households) whose total consumption per adult equivalent is below the food poverty line are considered in \"hardcore poverty.\"\n\n### The Headcount Ratio (HCR or P~0~)/Headcount Ratio (H)\n\nThe proportion of individuals (or households) whose total consumption falls below the poverty line. It is the most commonly used measure of poverty due to its simplicity and ease of interpretation.\n\n### Poverty Gap (P~1~)\n\nThe poverty gap index measures the average shortfall from the poverty line as a percentage. It reflects the mean distance of the poor from the poverty line, with those above the line considered to have zero shortfall. It also indicates the minimum cost to eliminate poverty under perfect targeting.\n\n### Squared Poverty Gap/Severity of Poverty\n\nThis index squares each poverty gap before averaging, placing greater weight on the poorest. It accounts for inequality among the poor. Proposed by Foster, Greer, and Thorbecke (1984), it is part of a class of poverty measures varying the weight of deprivation severity.\n\n### The Gini Index\n\nThe Gini coefficient measures inequality in consumption expenditure. A value of 0 indicates perfect equality, while a value of 100 indicates maximum inequality (i.e., one individual has all the expenditure).\n\n### Multidimensional Poverty\n\nA measure of poverty that considers factors beyond income, such as education, health, and living standards.\n\n## Climate Change\n\nClimate change refers to any significant change in the measures of climate lasting for an extended period of time. In other words, climate change includes major changes in temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns, among others, that occur over several decades or longer. It is attributed directly or indirectly to human (anthropogenic) activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere. The term is frequently used in reference to global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activities.\n\n### Climate\n\nRefers to the condition of the atmosphere at a particular location (microclimate) or region over a long period of time. It is the long-term summation of atmospheric elements – such as solar radiation, temperature, humidity, precipitation type (frequency and amount), atmospheric pressure, and wind (speed and direction) – and their variations.\n\n### Weather\n\nWeather is the state of the atmosphere of a given place at a given time. The elements of weather include, but are not limited to, rainfall, temperature, pressure, wind, cloud cover, and humidity.\n\n### Environment\n\nThe totality of all the external conditions (physical, biological, and socio-economic) affecting the life, development, and survival of an organism.\n\n### Climate Model\n\nA numerical representation of the climate system based on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of its components, their interactions, and feedback processes, and accounting for some of its known properties. The climate system can be represented by models of varying complexity; that is, for any one component or combination of components, a spectrum or hierarchy of models can be identified, differing in such aspects as the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to which physical, chemical, or biological processes are explicitly represented, or the level at which empirical parametrizations are involved.\n\n### Climate Prediction\n\nA probabilistic statement about future climate conditions on timescales ranging from seasons to decades. It is based on conditions known at present and assumptions about the physical processes that will determine future changes. When a projection is branded \"most likely,\" it becomes a prediction, and outputs of which can enable some level of confidence to be attached to projections.\n\n### Climate Projection\n\nThe simulated response of the climate system to a scenario of future emissions or concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and aerosols, generally derived using climate models. Projections provide a potential future evolution of a quantity or set of quantities, often computed with the aid of a model. Climate projections are distinguished from climate predictions by their dependence on the emission/concentration/radiative forcing scenario used, which is, in turn, based on assumptions concerning, for example, future socio-economic and technological developments that may or may not be realized. Unlike predictions, projections are conditional on assumptions concerning such future developments.\n\n### Climate-Resilient Pathways\n\nThe iterative processes for managing change within complex systems in order to reduce disruptions and enhance opportunities associated with climate change.\n\n### Climate Risk\n\nThe potential for consequences from climate variability and change where something of value is at stake and the outcome is uncertain. Often represented as the probability that a hazardous event or trend occurs multiplied by the expected impact. Risk results from the interaction of vulnerability, exposure, and hazard.\n\n### Climate Variability\n\nVariations in the mean state and other statistics (e.g., standard deviations, occurrence of extremes) of the climate across all spatial and temporal scales beyond that of individual weather events. Variability may be due to natural internal processes within the climate system (internal variability), or to variations in natural or anthropogenic external forcing (external variability).\n\n### Air Pollutants\n\nAir pollutants are substances in air that could, at high enough concentrations, harm human beings, animals, vegetation, or material. Air pollutants may consist of solid particles, liquid droplets, gases, or combinations of these forms.\n\n### Air Pollution\n\nAir pollution is the presence of contaminant or pollutant substances in the air that do not disperse properly and interfere with human health or welfare, or produce other harmful environmental effects.\n\n### Air Pollution Control\n\nAir pollution control refers to steps taken to maintain a standard of air purity for good public health, protection of plant and animal life and property, visibility, and safe ground and air transportation.\n\n### Air Pollution Index (API)\n\nAn air pollution index (API) is a quantitative measure that describes ambient air quality. The index is obtained by combining figures for various air pollutants into a single measurement.\n\n### Air Pollution Sources\n\nAir pollution sources are activities that result in air pollution, including agricultural activities, combustion processes, dust-producing processes, manufacturing activities, nuclear energy-related activities, spray painting, printing, dry cleaning, and so on.\n\n### Indoor Air Pollution\n\nIndoor air pollution refers to chemical, biological, and physical contamination of indoor air which may result in adverse health effects. In developing countries, the main source is biomass smoke, which contains suspended particulate matter (PM), nitrogen dioxide (NO₂), sulfur dioxide (SO₂), carbon monoxide (CO), formaldehyde, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).\n\n### Air Quality Criteria\n\nAir quality criteria are guidelines or standards established to protect human health and the environment from the harmful effects of air pollution. These criteria typically define acceptable concentrations of specific pollutants in the ambient (outdoor) air. They are used for various purposes, including public health protection, environmental protection, and urban planning.\n\n### Air Quality Standards\n\nAir quality standards refer to levels of air pollutants prescribed by regulations that may not be exceeded during a specified time in a defined area.\n\n### Allocation of Emissions to Final Demand\n\nAn analytical method, using input-output techniques, to describe emissions according to their origin (production, consumption, and imports) and final demand categories (final consumption, capital formation, and exports).\n\n### Emission\n\nEmission is the release of pollutants into the atmosphere (usually a gas when referring to climate change) from stationary sources such as smokestacks, other vents, surface areas of commercial or industrial facilities, and mobile sources, such as motor vehicles, locomotives, and aircraft.\n\n### Emission Damage\n\nEmission damage refers to the effects of (air) pollution on buildings, monuments, organisms, and ecosystems.\n\n### Emission Factor\n\nThe emission factor is the ratio between the amount of pollution generated and the amount of a given raw material processed. It may also refer to the ratio between emissions generated and the outputs of production processes.\n\n### Emission Inventory\n\nAn emission inventory is a listing, by source, of the amounts of pollutants actually or potentially discharged. Such an inventory is used to establish and put forth emission standards.\n\n### Emission Standard\n\nAn emission standard is the maximum amount of polluting discharge legally allowed from a single source, mobile or stationary.\n\n### Emissions Accounts\n\nHybrid flow accounts limited to the description of the uses of fossil fuels and corresponding air emissions.\n\n### Emissions Permits\n\nThe right to generate, in the course of production activity, a certain amount of specific emissions, for example, greenhouse gases. Emissions permits are a form of intangible non-produced assets.\n\n### Ozone\n\nOzone (O₃) is a pungent, colourless, toxic gas that contains three atoms of oxygen in each molecule. It occurs naturally at a concentration of about 0.01 parts per million (ppm) of air. Levels of 0.1 ppm are considered toxic. In the stratosphere, ozone provides a protective layer shielding the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. In the troposphere, it is a major component of photochemical smog, which seriously affects the human respiratory system.\n\n### Ozone Depletion\n\nOzone depletion is the destruction of ozone in the stratosphere, where it shields the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Its destruction is caused by chemical reactions in which oxides of hydrogen, nitrogen, chlorine, and bromine act as catalysts.\n\n### Ozonosphere\n\nThe ozonosphere is the lower region of the stratosphere, 15–25 kilometres above the Earth’s surface, in which there is an appreciable ozone concentration. It is also termed the ozone layer.\n\n### Ozone Depleting Potential\n\nThe aggregate measure of the ozone layer-depleting potential of substances, calculated through the conversion factor of halogenated hydrocarbons that contribute to ozone depletion into CFC-11 equivalents.\n\n### Protection of Climate and the Ozone Layer\n\nMeasures to control the emissions of greenhouse gases and gases that adversely affect the stratospheric ozone layer (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and halons).\n\n### Global Warming\n\nGlobal warming is a phenomenon believed to occur as a result of the build-up of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. It has been identified by many scientists as a major global environmental threat.\n\n### Global Warming Potential\n\nAn aggregate measure of the contribution to the greenhouse effect of some gases, expressed by converting them into carbon dioxide equivalents.\n\n### Greenhouse Gases\n\nGreenhouse gases refer to carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, methane, ozone, and chlorofluorocarbons, occurring both naturally and from human (production and consumption) activities, contributing to the greenhouse effect.\n\n### Greenhouse Effect\n\nThe greenhouse effect is the warming of the Earth’s atmosphere caused by a build-up of greenhouse gases that trap heat by allowing sunlight to enter but preventing heat from escaping.\n\n### Greenhouse Climate Response Index\n\nAn index developed by the U.S. National Climatic Data Center, including variables such as: much-above-normal temperature, high precipitation in cool months, extreme drought in warm months, a higher-than-normal proportion of annual precipitation falling on heavy-rain days, and reduced temperature variability.\n\n### Greenhouse Gas Indicator for Agriculture\n\nMeasures the gross agricultural emissions of carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous oxide (N₂O), expressed in CO₂ equivalents.\n\n### Carbon Dioxide\n\nA colourless, odourless, and non-poisonous greenhouse gas produced through the decomposition of organic matter in soils under oxidizing conditions and by the burning of fossil fuels.\n\n### Carbon Dioxide Emissions\n\nThe release of carbon dioxide gases and/or their precursors into the atmosphere over a specified area and period.\n\n### Carbon Dioxide Equivalent\n\nA measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases based on their global warming potential. For example, one million metric tons of methane is equivalent to 21 million metric tons of carbon dioxide over 100 years.\n\n### Carbon Tax\n\nAn instrument for environmental cost internalization. It is an excise tax on producers of raw fossil fuels based on their relative carbon content.\n\n### Decarbonization\n\nThe process by which countries or other entities aim to achieve a low-carbon economy or by which individuals aim to reduce their carbon consumption.\n\n### Particulate Matter\n\nFinely divided solids or liquids—such as soot, dust, fumes, mists, or aerosols—dispersed in air from combustion, industrial activities, or natural sources.\n\n### Disaster\n\nSevere disruption in the normal functioning of a community or society due to hazardous physical events interacting with vulnerable conditions, causing significant adverse effects and requiring emergency response.\n\n### Flood\n\nThe overflowing of a water body or accumulation of water in normally dry areas. Types include river floods, flash floods, urban floods, pluvial floods, sewer floods, coastal floods, and glacial lake outburst floods.\n\n### Drought\n\nA prolonged period of abnormally dry weather causing serious hydrological imbalance. Definitions vary based on precipitation impact on activities such as agriculture (agricultural drought), water supplies (hydrological drought), or meteorology (meteorological drought). A mega-drought is an exceptionally long and pervasive drought, usually lasting a decade or more.\n\n### Early Warning System\n\nThe set of capacities needed to generate and disseminate timely and meaningful warning information to enable preparedness and response by those threatened by a hazard.\n\n### Ecosystem\n\nA functional unit consisting of living organisms, their non-living environment, and the interactions between them. Ecosystem boundaries and components vary depending on the purpose of analysis, and ecosystems can range from very small to the entire biosphere.\n\n## Regional and Small Area Statistics\n\n### Direct Estimator\n\nA direct estimator uses data from a survey exclusively from an area to estimate an indicator for that area (i.e., the estimate is produced using only survey data). When the precision of the direct estimate is not adequate, oversampling within the domain or applying statistical techniques that allow reliable estimates in the domain may be necessary.\n\n### Population of Interest\n\nThe population for which the survey is designed, for example, households or persons living in a specific county or region.\n\n### Unit of Analysis\n\nRefers to the level at which a measurement is taken—for example, persons, households, farms, or establishments.\n\n### Variable of Interest / Target Variable / Dependent Variable\n\nThe information of interest to be captured by the survey, for example, consumption expenditure.\n\n### Auxiliary Variables / Auxiliary Information / Covariate\n\nVariables that affect the variables of interest, for example, age, education, sex, religion, etc.\n\n### Domain / Area\n\nA domain or area is defined as the subdivision for which estimations are desired. These can be planned domains (e.g., counties) or unplanned designs (e.g., sub-counties). \"Areas\" can be geographic or socio-economic delimitations or the result of cross-tabulating the two. Examples include geographic areas (state, county, school district, health service area), socio-demographic groups, or both (e.g., a specific age-sex-race group within a large geographic area), or other subpopulations (e.g., a set of firms belonging to a census division by industry group).\n\n### Small Area Estimation\n\nSmall area estimation is a set of methods used to achieve estimates of acceptable quality for publication. As statistical information is disaggregated into smaller population subgroups, it becomes noisier and yields larger coefficients of variation (CV), which may exceed the threshold established by the National Statistical Offices (NSO), above which they may choose not to publish that specific estimate.\n\n### Model-Based Small Area Estimates\n\nModel-based small area estimates rely on statistical models to establish a relationship between a dependent variable and a set of covariates. The covariates and parameters obtained from the fitted model are then used to predict the dependent variable in the auxiliary data.

A late registration is the registration of a vital event after the prescribed time period but within a specified grace period. In Kenya, the grace period is from the third to sixth month following the event.\n\n### Demographic transition\n\nThe demographic transition is the process by which populations move from high mortality and fertility rates to low mortality and fertility rates as a country develops from a pre-industrial to an industrialized economic system.

Transfers may be made between households, between households and government or between households and charities. Transfers are mainly  motivated by the intention to redistribute income. Transfers can consist of cash (monetary) or goods or of services and can cross national boundaries. Capital transfers are one-off or irregular and are usually large, lump-sum receipts. In contrast, current transfers usually recur regularly and tend to be small. Current transfers are also mostly available for use in consumption expenditure during the reference period while recipients of capital transfers do not usually regard them as income and do not use them wholly for consumption expenditure during the reference period.\n\n### Current Transfers (in cash and goods)\n\nCurrent transfers whether in cash or goods consist of social security pensions/schemes; pensions and other insurance benefits; current transfers from non-profit institutions and current transfers from other households.\n\n### Current Transfers (Services)\n\nThese aresocial transfers in kind from government-provided services to individual households such as education, health, social welfare, transport and cultural services.\n\n### Holding gains\n\nHolding gains are changes in the value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities over a reference period which occur without any direct action of the owner, for example, changes in the value of stocks and shares.

Social insurance includes contributory pensions; health, unemployment, or disaster insurance; and funeral assistance. Social insurance is strongly linked to the formal labour market, meaning coverage is often limited to formal workers.\n\n### Social pensions\n\nThese are state pensions, a form of cash transfer targeted by age. Pensions are the most common social protection tool, with the widest global coverage and often highest national spend. The current pensions schemes in Kenya comprise the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) which is a state contributory scheme mandatory for all employers and employees in the formal sector and informal sector workers who can contribute on voluntary basis, Civil Servants Pension Scheme which is non-contributory and administered by The National Treasury for the government for retired civil servants and (iii) private pension schemes.\n\n### Social risks\n\nDefined as events or circumstances that may adversely affect the welfare of households either by imposing additional demands on their resources or by reducing their income. Needs may occur due to sickness, unemployment, retirement, housing, education, or family circumstances.\n\n### Social Security\n\nSocial security is defined as the security that the society furnishes through appropriate organizations against certain risks to which its members are exposed. The concept of social security is based on ideas of human dignity and social justice. The underlying idea behind social security measures is that a citizen who has contributed or is likely to con­tribute to his/her country’s welfare should be given protection against certain hazards. The concept of social security, thus, is based on the ideals of human dignity and socio-economic justice. Underlying the concept is also the desire to give protection to its citizens to contribute to a coun­try’s total welfare against certain hazards of life to which they are exposed either in the working life or as a consequence of it.\n\n### The Cash Transfer for Orphans and Vulnerable Children (CT-OVC)\n\nThis is a poverty-targeted and household-based programme with the objective of providing regular cash transfers to poor families living with children identified as OVCs to encourage fostering and retention of children and promote their human capital development.

Therefore, the participation rate for the activity is required, and two series of tables are presented:\n\n1.       Average time spent per day by the population and\n\n2.     Average time spent per day by persons who engaged in the activity.\n\nBasic time use statistics typically provide estimates of the average time spent per day on various types of activities by individuals within specific demographic groups. These categories may include men, women, boys, and girls within certain age groups, as well as distinctions such as rural or urban residence, employment status, and more. To ensure accurate averages, time use data should encompass both weekdays and weekends, and account for seasonal variations throughout the year.\n\n### Participation rate\n\nThe participation rate refers to the proportion of individuals in the survey population who took part in a specific activity during the reference period, such as in  the last 24 hours.\n\n### Time slot\n\nA one-hour interval within a 24-hour period during which respondents reported one or more activities.\n\n### Simultaneous activities\n\nSimultaneous activities are those undertaken by the same person at the same time and place. For instance: cooking while listening to the radio, or cleaning the house while caring for the children etc.\n\n### System of National Accounts (SNA) Productive\n\nActivities within the SNA production boundary include the production of goods and services supplied or intended to be supplied to others, own-account production of goods retained by producers, own-account production of housing services by owner-occupiers and of domestic and personal services produced in a household by paid domestic staff.\n\nThe SNA excludes unpaid household activities that produce domestic or personal services for consumption within the same household, except when performed by paid staff.\n\n### Non-SNA productive (extended SNA)\n\nNon-SNA include unpaid domestic and personal services produced and consumed within the same household, such as cleaning, maintenance, and repairs, meal preparation and serving, care and instruction of children, care for the sick, elderly, or infirm, transportation of household members or their goods and unpaid volunteer services to other households, communities, or associations\n\n### Non-productive activities\n\nAn activity is considered non-productive if it cannot be delegated to someone else, according to the \"third-person rule.\" These include personal maintenance activities such as eating, sleeping, exercising and leisure or recreational activities such as watching TV, playing games and hobbies.\n\n### Productive work\n\nProductive work refers to activities that can be delegated to another person and still produce the same result. All such activities fall within the general production boundary.\n\n### Reproductive work\n\nReproductive work includes activities such as rearing and caring for children; caring for the elderly, ill, disabled and other household members; caring unpaid for non-family members; and cooking, cleaning and fetching water and fuel. Though these activities are productive, they are not included in GDP calculations.\n\n### Care of children and adults\n\nThis refers to time spent caring for or helping any child (under 18) or adult in the household, regardless of their health status. Care is categorized into:\n\n### Primary childcare\n\nTime spent directly and exclusively on a child while not engaged in any other activity, such as feeding, bathing, playing, or helping with homework.\n\n### Primary adult care\n\nTime spent directly helping or caring for an adult, such as bathing, grooming, or assisting with household tasks like cleaning or cooking.\n\n### Secondary care of children and adults\n\nCare provided while engaged in another primary activity. For example, watching over a child doing homework while cooking dinner or watching over a sick parent while doing house chores\n\n### Time-use surveys\n\nStatistical survey that aims to report data on how people spend their time. If the necessary R&D coefficients cannot be derived from other surveys or administrative data, time-use surveys are the recommended method to derive the necessary informationfor estimating the R&D component of full-time equivalents (FTEs) and expenditures.\n\n### Passive Care\n\nMonitoring or supervising another person without direct interaction. For example, watching children get dressed or supervising a family member taking medication. This may occur while performing other tasks or as a primary activity.\n\n### Active Care\n\nActive care involves direct interaction with the person being cared for. Examples include helping someone dress or administering medication.\n\n### Household Production Satellite Account\n\nA statistical framework that estimates the value of unpaid work in the household, such as childcare, adult care, housework, and volunteering. Specifically, the household production satellite accounts show the relation between the monetary value of unpaid work to the total GDP providing relevant information that complements the GDP.\n\n### Simultaneous or parallel activities\n\nThese involve performing two or more activities during the same time interval. The primary activity is the one whose value added exceeds that of other activities and it's deemed most important or requiring the most concentration. The secondary activity is carried out at the same time as the primary activity but considered of lesser importance\n\n### Time-use diaries\n\nDiaries that capture all activities undertaken by a respondent over a defined reference period (e.g. a full 24-hour period, a weekday and a weekend day, a full week, etc.). They capture start and end times, activity duration, sequence, and frequency.\n\n### Activity classification system\n\nA structured system that categorizes activities into groups to analyze how people spend their time. It supports policymaking and statistical reporting through a hierarchical structure that assigns numeric codes to each activity.\n\n### International Classification of Activities for Time-Use Statistics (ICATUS):\n\nA standard classification of all activities that the general population may engage in over a 24 hours period. The classification provides categories for compiling internationally comparable time-use statistic\n\nPaid work\n\nUnpaid work\n\n### Productive activity\n\nan activity is considered productive if it can be delegated to someone else or if it yields an output that is capable of being exchanged.\n\n### Unproductive activity/Personal care activity\n\nActivities performed for personal maintenance and care such as eating, drinking, sleeping, exercising etc. are non-productive or personal activities: these cannot be delegated to a person other than the one benefiting from them. Similarly, activities associated with socializing, entertainment, participation in sports, hobbies and games, and use of mass media are considered non-productive activities.\n\n# Economic Statistics\n\n## Macroeconomic accounts and statistics\n\n### System of National Accounts\n\n#### System of National Accounts (SNA)\n\nThe internationally agreed standard set of recommendations on how to compile measures of economic activity. It is a comprehensive, consistent and flexible set of macroeconomic accounts to meet the needs of government and private-sector analysts, policymakers, and decision-takers.\n\n#### Gross Domestic Product (GDP)\n\nThe total value of goods and services produced by resident producer units of a country for a specified period of time, usually one year. It is the sum of gross value added of all resident producer units (institutional sectors or industries).\n\n#### GDP at Market Prices\n\nThe sum total of the gross values added of all resident producers at producers’ prices, less subsidies on imports, plus all non-deductible Value Added Taxes (VAT) (or similar taxes).\n\n#### GDP at current Prices\n\nThe total value of goods and services valued at prices of the particular year of reporting. This is also referred to as nominal GDP.\n\n#### Base Year\n\nThe year used as the base period for compilation of constant price estimates. The base year is reflected to be normal i.e. a year without major  shocks or structural changes. The base year of the national accounts is chosen to allow for year-to-year comparisons.\n\n#### GDP at Constant Prices\n\nThe total value of goods and services for a particular period based on prices of a pre-determined base year.\n\n#### GDP per Capita\n\nThe average production per person of goods and services for a specified period e.g. one year. It is used to compare the relative welfare or standard of living in different countries in a particular period.\n\n#### Gross Output\n\nOutput that consists of goods or services that are produced within an establishment that become available for use outside that establishment, plus any goods and services produced for own final use.\n\n#### Intermediate Consumption\n\nConsists of the value of the goods and services consumed as inputs by a process of production, excluding fixed assets whose consumption is recorded as consumption of fixed capital; the goods or services may be either transformed or used up by the production process.\n\n#### Gross Value Added (GVA)\n\nGVA is derived as the gross output less the intermediate consumption.\n\n#### Compensation of Employees\n\nThis is the total remuneration in cash or in kind paid to employees and comprises wages and salaries and the value of social contributions paid by employers.\n\n#### Operating Surplus\n\nThe operating surplus measures the surplus or deficit accruing from production before taking account of any interest, rent or similar charges payable on financial or tangible non-produced assets borrowed or rented by the enterprise, or any interest, rent or similar receipts receivable on financial or tangible non-produced assets owned by the enterprise; (note: for unincorporated enterprises owned by households, this component is called \"mixed income\").\n\n#### Mixed Income\n\nThe surplus or deficit accruing from production by unincorporated enterprises owned by households; it implicitly contains an element of remuneration for work done by the owner, or other members of the household, that cannot be separately identified from the return to the owner as entrepreneur, but it excludes the operating surplus coming from owner-occupied dwellings.\n\n#### Other Taxes on Production\n\nTaxes other than those incurred directly as a result of engaging in production; they mainly consist of current taxes on the labour or capital employed in the enterprise, such as payroll taxes or current taxes on vehicles or buildings.\n\n#### Basic Prices\n\nThe amount receivable by the producer from the purchaser for a unit of a good or service produced as output minus any tax payable, and plus any subsidy receivable, on that unit as a consequence of its production or sale; it excludes any transport charges invoiced separately by the producer.\n\n#### Purchasers’ Prices\n\nThe amount paid by the purchaser, excluding any deductible VAT or similar deductible tax, in order to take delivery of a unit of a good or service at the time and place required by the purchaser; the purchaser's price of a good includes any transport charges paid separately by the purchaser to take delivery at the required time and place.\n\n#### Government Final Consumption Expenditure\n\nExpenditure, including imputed expenditure, incurred by the general government on both individual consumption goods and services and collective consumption services.\n\n#### General Government\n\nThe sector consists of the totality of institutional units which, in addition to fulfilling their political responsibilities and their role of economic regulation, produce principally non-market services (possibly goods) for individual or collective consumption and redistribute income and wealth.\n\n#### Household/Private Final Consumption Expenditure (HFCE)\n\nExpenditure incurred by the resident households on final consumption of goods and services, whether made within or outside the economic territory.\n\n#### Final consumption expenditure by NPISH\n\nThe Private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) is defined as the expenditure incurred by the resident non-profit institutions serving households (NPISH) on final consumption of goods and services, whether made within or outside the economic territory.\n\n#### Gross Fixed Capital Formation\n\nThis is measured as the total value of a producer's acquisitions, less disposals, of fixed assets during the accounting period plus certain additions to the value of non-produced assets realised by the productive activity of institutional units. Expenditure on mineral exploration and military ware not used purely for war purposes are included in GFCF. However, intangible assets, such as copyrights, computer software etc, are not included due to unavailability of reliable data.\n\n#### Fixed Assets\n\nTangible or intangible assets produced as outputs from processes of production that are themselves used repeatedly or continuously in other processes of production for more than one year.\n\n#### Consumption of Fixed Capital\n\nConstitutes the decline in the value of the fixed assets owned by an enterprise, as a result of their physical deterioration and normal rates of obsolescence and accidental damage. In other words it is the wear and tear of an asset during the accounting period.\n\n#### Changes in Inventories\n\nChanges in inventories (including work-in-progress) consist of changes in :(a) stocks of outputs that are still held by the units that produced them prior to their being further processed, sold, delivered to other units or used in other ways; and(b) stocks of products acquired from other units that are intended to be used for intermediate consumption or for resale without further processing; they are measured by the value of the entries into inventories less the value of withdrawals and the value of any recurrent losses of goods held in inventories.\n\n#### GDP by Production Approach\n\nThe production approach, which is also called the output approach, measures GDP as the difference between value of output less the value of goods and services used in producing these outputs during an accounting period\n\n#### GDP by Expenditure Approach\n\nGDP by expenditure approach also known as the aggregate demand is defined as private final consumption expenditure + government final consumption expenditure + gross capital formation + exports - imports.\n\n#### GDP by Income approach\n\nThe income approach estimates GDP as the sum of the incomes receivable by each institutional sector from the domestic production of goods and services.\n\n#### Gross National Income (GNI)\n\nThe aggregate value of the gross balances of primary incomes for all sectors. GNI is the gross domestic product, plus net receipts from abroad of compensation of employees, property income and net taxes less subsidies on production.\n\n#### Gross National Disposable Income\n\nGross national disposable income may be derived from gross national income by adding all current transfers in cash or in kind receivable by resident institutional units from non-resident units and subtracting all current transfers in cash or in kind payable by resident institutional units to non-resident units.\n\n#### Saving\n\nNet saving is net disposable income less final consumption expenditure.\n\n#### Net Lending/Borrowing\n\nNet amount a unit or a sector has available to finance, directly or indirectly, other units or other sectors; it is the balancing item in the capital account and is defined as: (Net saving plus capital transfers receivable minus capital transfers payable) minus (the value of acquisitions less disposals of non-financial assets, less consumption of fixed capital); negative net lending may also be described as \"net borrowing\".\n\n#### GDP Statistical Discrepancy\n\nThis is the difference between GDP compiled by the various approaches, e.g. the difference between GDP by production approach and GDP by expenditure approach.\n\n#### Supply and use Tables\n\nThe Supply Table describes how goods and services become available in an economy during a certain period of time. Products are either produced in the domestic industry or imported.  The Use Table shows how goods and services are used in the economy during a certain period of time.\n\n#### Input-Output Tables\n\nAn input-output table is a means of presenting a detailed analysis of the process of production and the use of goods and services (products) and the income generated in that production.; they can be either in the form of (a) supply and use tables or (b) symmetric input-output tables.\n\n#### Social Accounting Matrices (SAM)\n\nA means of presenting the SNA accounts in a matrix which elaborates the linkages between a supply and use table and institutional sector accounts; a typical focus of a SAM on the role of people in the economy may be reflected by, among other things, extra breakdowns of the household sector and a disaggregated representation of labour markets (i.e., distinguishing various categories of employed persons).\n\n#### Satellite Accounts\n\nSatellite accounts provide a framework linked to the central accounts and which enables attention to be focussed on a certain field or aspect of economic and social life in the context of national accounts; common examples are satellite accounts for the environment, or tourism, or unpaid household work.\n\n### Balance of payments and international investment position\n\n#### Balance of Payments\n\nA systematic statistical statement that summarizes for a given period (e.g. calendar year), an economy’s transactions with the rest of the world. BOP captures transactions between residents and nonresidents, irrespective of the currency in which the transaction is made. BOP comprises the Current Account (Goods and Services; Primary Income; and Secondary Income) and the Capital and Financial Accounts.\n\n#### Current Account\n\nThe current account focuses on transactions related to the exchange of goods, services, income, and current transfers. It consists of Goods, Services, Primary Income and Secondary Income sub-accounts.\n\n#### Goods Account\n\nIncludes the export and import of physical goods (merchandise). It also includes trade in goods by a resident and subsequent resale of these goods without them being physically present in the country. This concept is referred to as merchanting.\n\n#### Services Account\n\nIt covers the export and import of services. These are categorized into twelve broad categories in the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition (BPM6) as follows; Manufacturing of Physical Inputs owned by Others; Maintenance and Repair Services; Transport; Travel; Construction; Insurance and Pension Services; Financial Services; Charges for the use of  intellectual property n.i.e; Telecommunications, Computer and Information Services; Other Business Services (including Trade, Technical and related services,Research and development services, professional and management consulting services, waste treatment and depollution, agricultural and mining services, operating leasing, Trade related services ; Personal, cultural and recreation services; and Government  goods and services n.i.e\n\n#### Primary Income Account\n\nPrimary income captures returns for the provision of labor and financial assets; and renting of natural resources between resident and non-resident entities. This account records compensation of employees, income from investments such as dividends, interest, reinvested earnings; investment income attributable to policyholders in insurance, standardized guarantees, and pension funds; and rent.\n\n#### Secondary Income Account\n\nThis account records transfers of money or value between residents and non-residents, where no goods or services are exchanged. This includes:\n\n·       Personal transfers: All current transfers in cash or in kind made or received by resident households to or from nonresident households. They include remittances sent by workers to their families in their home countries.\n\n·       Other current transfers: These include Social contributions, social benefits,net premiums and claims on non-life insurance, Contributions from foreign governments, charitable donations, and other financial transfers, including aid and gifts.\n\n#### Current Account Balance\n\nThe current account balance is the sum of the balances of the four sub-accounts:\n\nCurrent Account Balance (CAB) = Balance of the Goods Account + Services Account Balance + Balance in the Primary Income Account + Balance in the Secondary Income Account\n\n#### Current Account Surplus/Deficit\n\nA current account surplus occurs when a country earns more income from abroad than it spends i.e. the CAB is a positive value. On the other hand, a current account deficit results from greater expenditure on goods produced or services rendered by non-residents as well as increased payments on factors of production, including interest and labour.\n\n#### Capital Account\n\nThis account shows (a) capital transfers receivable and payable between residents and nonresidents and (b) the acquisition and disposal of non-produced, nonfinancial assets between residents and nonresidents.\n\nCapital transfers are transfers in which the ownership of an asset (other than cash or inventories) changes from one party to another; or which obliges one or both parties to acquire or dispose of an asset (other than cash or inventories); or where a liability is forgiven by the creditor. This include debt forgiveness, investment grants, one-off guarantees and debt assumption, large gifts and inheritances (legacies), including those to nonprofit  institutions; cash grants from donor governments or multilateral financial institutions to the debtor economy to be used to repay debt\n\nNon-produced, non-financial assets consist of natural resources, contracts, leases and licenses; and marketing assets (including goodwill).\n\n#### Financial Account\n\nThis account records transactions that involve financial assets and liabilities that take place between residents and nonresidents. It tracks cross-border investments and transactions that change the ownership of financial assets and liabilities. The financial account indicates the functional categories, sectors, instruments and maturities used for net international financing transactions. Entries in the financial account can be corresponding entries to goods, services, income, capital account, or other financial account entries. The financial account shows net acquisition of financial assets and net incurrence of liabilities. There are five functional categories in the Financial Account which include Direct Investment, Portfolio Investment, Other Investment, Financial Derivatives  and Reserve Assets.\n\n#### Direct Investment\n\nThis arises when an entity, resident in one economy has equity shareholding or equivalent voting rights of 10% per cent or more in an entity resident in another economy that gives rise to a significant degree of influence or control in the management of this non-resident entity. A significant degree of influence exists when the non-resident Direct Investor has shareholding or equivalent voting rights of between 10 to 50 per cent of the value resident entity while control exists when the shareholding is more than 50 per cent.\n\nEnterprises in a direct investment relationship with each other are called affiliates or affiliated enterprises. In addition, all enterprises that are under the control or influence of the same direct investor are considered to be in a direct investment relationship with each other.\n\n#### Portfolio Investment\n\nThis is defined as cross border transactions and positions involving debt or equity securities, other than those included in direct investment or reserve assets. Investments by a non-resident in an economy in form of shares/voting rights of less than 10% (equity securities) and/or investment in financial instruments which are tradable (debt/non-equity securities). The negotiability of securities is a way of facilitating trading, allowing them to be held by different parties during their lives.\n\nPortfolio investment covers, but is not limited to, securities traded on organized or other financial markets and usually involves financial infrastructure, such as a suitable legal, regulatory, and settlement framework, along with market-making dealers, and a sufficient volume of buyers and sellers. Transactions in listed equity in the Securities markets or organized exchanges constitute Portfolio Investment.\n\n#### Other Investment\n\nThis captures any other investment by a non-resident in an economy that cannot be classified either as Direct Investment, Portfolio Investment, financial derivatives and employee stock options; and reserve assets. This comprises other equity (less than 10% of voting rights and non-tradable); currency and deposits; loans (including the use of IMF credit and loans from the IMF); trade credits and advances; insurance, pension and standardized guarantee schemes; accounts payable and receivable; and SDR allocations.\n\nOther investments may be split by financial asset or liability class, original or remaining maturity, or institutional sector.\n\n#### Reserve Assets\n\nReserve assets are those external assets that are readily available to and controlled by monetary authorities for meeting balance of payments financing needs, for intervention in exchange markets to affect the currency exchange rate, and for other related purposes (such as maintaining confidence in the currency and the economy; and serving as a basis for foreign borrowing). This includes central bank holdings of foreign exchange reserves, monetary gold, Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) holdings, Reserve Position in the Fund and debt securities .\n\n#### International Investment Position\n\nInternational Investment Position (IIP) is a statistical statement that shows at a point in time the value and composition of financial assets of residents of an economy that are claims on nonresidents and gold bullion held as reserve assets; and liabilities of residents of an economy to non residents. The key components of IIP are similar to the components of the Financial Account of the Balance of Payments and include Direct Investment Assets/Liabilities, Portfolio Investment Assets/Liabilities, Other Investment Assets/Liabilities, Financial derivatives and Reserve Assets.\n\nThe difference between an economy’s external financial assets and liabilities is the economy’s net IIP, which may be positive or negative.\n\n#### Financial Assets\n\nThese are financial claims by residents of a country on non-residents/rest of the world. The existence of the counterpart liability distinguishes financial assets from other economic assets, such as land, dwellings, machinery, equipment, etc.\n\n#### Financial Liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are financial claims on residents by non-residents/rest of the world.\n\n#### Rest of the world\n\nConsists of all non-resident institutional units that enter into transactions with resident units, or have other economic links with resident units.\n\n#### Residency\n\nA resident is an individual, entity or organization located in an economic territory, with which it has the centre of predominant economic interest. An enterprise incorporated in Kenya is considered a resident of Kenya irrespective of the location of the owners of the enterprise. A branch of a foreign enterprise operating (or intending to operate) in Kenya for more than a year is treated as a resident of Kenya. A household is resident in the economic territory in which household members maintain or intend to maintain a dwelling or succession of dwellings treated and used by members of the household as their principal dwelling. If an individual is present in a territory for one year or more or intending to do so is sufficient to qualify as having a principal dwelling there. If there is uncertainty about the principal dwelling, the length of time spent there should inform whether they are resident or not.\n\nA legal entity is resident in the economic territory under whose laws the entity is incorporated or registered. If there is no incorporation or registration, legal domicile is used to ascertain the residence of the entity.\n\nA Non Profit Institutions Serving Households (NPISH) has a center of economic interest in the economy in which the institution was legally created and is officially recognized and recorded as a legal or social entity. When an NPISH is engaged in charity or relief work on an international scale, it may maintain substantial operations for individual territories that may amount to branches.\n\nAn exception to this rule includes the following:\n\n1.       Diplomats of Foreign Governments, Embassies, Military bases of foreign governments, cross-border workers, Patients and Students who are residents of their economies.\n\n2.     International/multilateral organizations who are not residents of any Government e.g. World Bank Group, International Monetary Fund. International organizations are resident in an economic territory of their own, and not of the economy in which they are physically located. Some international organizations cover a group of economies in a particular region, such as with economic or currency unions. If statistics are prepared for that region as a whole, these regional organizations are residents of the region as a whole, even though they are not residents of any member economy.\n\n#### Transactions\n\nA transaction is an interaction between two institutional units that occurs by mutual agreement or through the operation of the law and involves an exchange of value or a transfer. Transactions are classified according to the nature of the economic value provided—namely, goods or services, primary income, secondary income, capital transfers, nonproduced non-financial assets, financial assets, or liabilities. Transactions recorded in the BOP. are interactions between a resident and a nonresident institutional unit.\n\n#### Positions\n\nStock of financial assets and liabilities at a specific point in time and are recorded in the IIP.\n\n#### Financial Instruments\n\nThese are financial contracts made between institutional units and can be broadly divided into:\n\n·       Equity and Investment Fund shares: These include shares and other forms of ownership in an enterprise.\n\n·       Non-Equity/Debt Instruments: These include currency and deposits, debt securities, loans, trade credits and advances; other accounts receivables/payables, insurance, pension and standardized guarantee schemes, financial derivatives and employee stock options are also included in other financial instruments.\n\n#### Reinvested Earnings\n\nIncome on equity not paid out to investors as dividends but retained in the enterprise (e.g., retained profits).\n\n#### Revaluations\n\nChanges in the value of assets due to price changes and reflect nominal hold- ing gains and losses on environmental assets. The nominal holding gain for environmental assets is calculated in the same way as for non-financial assets, as the increase in value accruing to the owner of the asset as a result of a change in its price over a period of time. Holding gains and losses are realized when the asset is sold or liability extinguished. Holding gains and losses on unsold assets and unpaid liabilities are unrealized but are recorded as revaluations.\n\n#### Special Drawing Rights (SDRs)\n\nSDRs are an international reserve asset created by the IMF, used to supplement its member countries' official reserves. SDR holdings represent unconditional rights to obtain foreign exchange or other reserve assets from other IMF members. SDR holdings are classified as reserve assets in while SDR allocations are captured in Other Investments liabilities.\n\n#### Valuation Principles\n\nValuation principles for measuring cross-border transactions and positions are market prices or book values for assets and liabilities.\n\n#### Accrual Accounting\n\nAccrual accounting records flows at the time economic value is created, transformed, exchanged, transferred, or extinguished. This means that flows that imply a change of economic ownership are recorded when ownership passes and services are recorded when provided, irrespective of whether cash was received or paid or was due to be received or paid.\n\n#### Market Value\n\nMarket prices for transactions are defined as amounts of money that willing buyers pay to acquire something from willing sellers; the exchanges are made between independent parties and on the basis of commercial considerations only—sometimes called “at arm’s length”. Transactions in loans, deposits, and other accounts receivable/ payable also should be valued at market prices. Transactions in financial assets and liabilities should be recorded exclusive of any commissions, fees, and taxes whether charged explicitly, included in the purchaser’s price, or deducted from the seller’s proceeds. When market prices for transactions are not observable, valuation according to market-equivalent prices provides approximation to market prices. In such cases, market prices of the same or similar items when such prices exist will provide a good basis for applying the principle of market prices.\n\n#### Book Value\n\nThe value recorded in the enterprises records.\n\n#### Nominal Value\n\nThe outstanding amount the debtor owes to the creditor, which is composed of the outstanding principal amount including any accrued interest. Therefore, the nominal value reflects the sum of funds originally advanced, plus any subsequent advances, plus any interest that has accrued, less any repayments (which includes any payments covering interest accrual). If a debt instrument is denominated in foreign currency, the corresponding nominal value of the instrument in domestic currency also includes holding gains or losses arising from exchange rate changes.\n\n#### Amortized value\n\nThe amortized value of a loan reflects the process of gradual elimination of the liability by regular payments over a specified period of time. On the date of each scheduled payment, amortized value is the same as nominal value, but it may differ from the nominal value on other dates because nominal value includes interest that has accrued and not been paid.\n\n#### Face value\n\nThe undiscounted amount to be paid to the holder at maturity. It is also known as “par value” or simply “par.” Before maturity, the market value of a bond may be greater or lesser than the face value, depending on the interest rate payable and the perceived risk of default. As bonds approach maturity, market value approaches face value. For example, if interest rates are higher than the bond’s coupon rate, then the bond is sold at a discount (below par). Conversely, if interest rates are lower than the bond’s coupon rate, then the bond is sold at a premium (above par).\n\n#### Net Errors and Omissions\n\nIn practice, data may not perfectly match due to various statistical discrepancies, either from source data or from compilation. This gives rise to net errors and omissions. While net errors and omissions is a residual item, the size and trends may help identify data problems, such as coverage or misreporting. Patterns in net errors and omissions may provide useful information on data problems. While it is not possible to have guidelines on an acceptable size for net errors and omissions, it can be assessed in relation to other items, such as GDP, current account balance, positions data, and gross flows.\n\n#### Institutional Sectors\n\nBPM6 provides guidance for compilation of BOP and IIP by attributing institutional units to the following sectors:\n\n●       Central Bank\n\n○      Deposit taking Corporations except the Central Bank\n\n○      General government\n\n●       Other Sectors\n\n■       Other financial corporations\n\n●       Moneymarketfunds(MMFs)\n\n●       Non-MMF Investment funds\n\n●       Other financial intermediaries except insurance corporations and pension funds (ICPFs)\n\n●        Financial auxiliaries\n\n●       Captive financial institutions and money lenders\n\n●        Insurance corporations\n\n●       Pension funds\n\n■       Non-financial corporations, households, and NPISHs\n\n●       Nonfinancial corporations\n\n●        Households\n\n●       NPISHs (non-profit institutions serving households; maybe combined with households)\n\nThe full institutional sector detail is required for international accounts to be fully integrated with monetary, flow of funds, and other financial data.\n\n#### Exceptional Financing\n\nBrings together financial arrangements made by the authorities (or by other sectors fostered by authorities) of an economy to meet Balance of Payments needs. Arrears related to exceptional financing are recorded below the line as transactions in the analytical presentation of the Balance of Payments with the corresponding entry in the relevant instrument.\n\n#### The International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS)\n\nThis is a data collection system that obtains data from banks and companies at the level of individual transactions. An ideal ITRS measures: (1) cash transactions with nonresidents that pass through domestic banks; (2) cash transactions that pass-through enterprise accounts with banks abroad; (3) transactions on intercompany accounts with nonresident companies; (4) positions; and (5) noncash transactions.\n\nStatistics are compiled from forms submitted to/by domestic banks and from forms submitted by companies.\n\nHowever, the efficacy of the ITRS is based on the legal framework, accounting systems, and foreign exchange regulations of various economies. In Kenya, the ITRS is a major data source on cross border transactions. However, it is not sufficient to address all the BOP requirements hence the use of complimentary data sources, including surveys to enterprises.\n\n#### Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition\n\nThe Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, Sixth Edition (BPM6) is a comprehensive set of guidelines published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

As opposed to aquaculture, fishing does not entail application of inputs among other fish farming practices.\n\n#### Pond culture\n\nThis is the breeding or rearing of fish or other aquatic plants and animals in natural or artificial enclosures. Pond culture is usually carried out in stagnant waters with periodic water exchange or water flushing through inlets and outlets.\n\n#### Cage aquaculture\n\nInvolves the growing of fishes in existing water resources while being enclosed in a net cage, which allows free flow of water.\n\n#### Area of Aquaculture\n\nThe area under water used for aquaculture on the holding. This may be of three types: land-based, based on inland water, and based on coastal waters. The two latter types of areas are parts of bodies of water, usually rented from others for use for aqua cultural purposes.\n\n#### Land-Based Aquaculture\n\nThis is aquaculture practiced in rice fields, ponds, tanks, raceways, and other land areas on the holding.\n\n#### In-Land Water / Freshwater Aquaculture\n\nThis is aquaculture practiced in freshwater sources like dams, rivers, lakes, reservoirs and groundwater. It is commonly practiced in ponds.\n\n#### Marine Aquaculture\n\nAlso known as Mariculture, is the cultivation of fish in saltwater, seawater, such as inshore and open waters and inland. Production comprises different culture ecosystems, earthen ponds, cages and pens, raceways, tanks, and recirculating systems.\n\n#### Brackish Water Aquaculture\n\nAquaculture systems generally installed in estuaries, bays, lagoons. It involves installation of fish farming systems at these water points and culturing of various species of fish up to harvesting stage.\n\n#### Cages\n\nIt involves raising fish and other aquatic animals in enclosures called cages or pens. The cages are made of netting or mesh and are placed in natural bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, or coastal areas. The cages are made of mesh, wood, or net screens and are enclosed on all or most sides, with an opening at the top for feeding.\n\n#### Tanks\n\nStructures used to raise aquatic animals or plants in a controlled environment. They can be small, round, or rectangular and are usually built above ground using materials such as bricks, concrete or plastic. Tanks allow for careful management of fish growth, feeding and health.\n\n#### Raceways\n\nChannels or open water courses used in commercial aquaculture to raise fish in a high-density, intensive system. These are fixed structures that are used for raising aquatic organisms or plants. These structures are elongated, narrow channels, unlike tanks. Raceways are constructed above the ground and designed to allow water to flow continuously through them. This flow of water enables efficient feeding and waste removal.\n\n#### Dams\n\nStagnant waters created as a result of barriers erected to stop or restrict the flow of water or underground streams, sometimes used for integrated aquaculture and energy production. In terms of size, dams are generally larger than 1.0 ha but smaller than 100 ha.\n\n#### Pond\n\nSmall, artificial body of water that is stocked with fish. It can be in form of earthen pond, lined pond, concrete pond or raised ponds.\n\n#### Pond Liming\n\nProcess of adding calcium or calcium and magnesium compounds to a pond to neutralize acidity and improve its productivity. It also acts as disinfectant of the system.\n\n####  Fertilization\n\nProcess of adding nutrients to a pond to increase the number of phytoplankton and other aquatic life, which in turn provides more food for fish.\n\n####  Aquaponics\n\nThe combination of aquaculture and hydroponics. In aquaponics, the nutrient-rich water that results from raising fish provides a source of natural fertilizer for the growing plants. As the plants consume the nutrients, they help to purify the water that the fish live in. A natural microbial process keeps both the fish and plants healthy. Aquaponics therefore produces both fish and organic or chemical free fruits and vegetables, in a dynamic, pond- type ecosystem.\n\n####  Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS):\n\nA way of fish farming or rearing fish at high densities, in green houses or in tanks or in raceways in a \"controlled\" environment.\n\n####  Fishing Craft\n\nThe means through which fishing ground can be accessed.\n\n####  Fishing Gear\n\nA tool or equipment used to capture fish from the water.

Electricity can be generated through different processes such as the conversion of energy contained in falling or streaming water, wind or waves; the direct conversion of solar radiation through photovoltaic processes in semiconductor devices (solar cells); or by the combustion of fuels.\n\nIn Kenya, electric power is mainly generated from renewable sources like Geothermal, solar and wind and/or non-renewable sources including thermal sources.\n\n#### Main activity producers\n\nThese are units that produce electricity or heat as their principal activity. Formerly known as public utilities, these enterprises may be privately or publicly owned companies.\n\n#### Autoproducers (electricity)\n\nThese are units that produce electricity, but for which the production is not their principal activity.\n\n#### Autoproducers (heat)\n\nThese are units that produce heat for sale, but for which the production is not their principal activity. Deliveries of fuels for heat generated by a unit for its own purposes are classified as final consumption, and not as transformation inputs.\n\n#### Electricity plants\n\nPlants producing only electricity. The electricity may be obtained directly from natural sources such as hydro, geothermal, wind, tidal, marine, solar energy or from fuel cells, or from the heat obtained from the combustion of fuels or nuclear reactions.\n\n#### CHP plants\n\nPlants that produce both heat and electricity from at least one generating unit in the plant. They are sometimes referred to as “co-generation” plants.\n\n#### Heat plants\n\nPlants (including heat pumps and electric boilers) designed to produce heat only for deliveries to third parties.

Heat from concentrating solar thermal refers to high temperature heat produced from solar radiation captured by concentrating solar thermal systems.\n\nThe high temperature heat can be transformed to generate electricity, drive chemical reactions, or be used directly in industrial processes. Heat from non-concentrating solar thermal refers to low temperature heat produced from solar radiation captured by non-concentrating solar thermal systems. The heat can be used for applications, such as space heating, cooling, water heating, district heating and industrial processes.\n\n#### Energy Consumers\n\nIn energy statistics, energy consumers consist of economic units (enterprises and households) that act as final users of energy; they use energy products for energy purposes (heat raising, transportation and electrical services) and/or for non-energy purposes. It should be noted that the economic units belonging to the energy industries that use energy to produce other energy products are excluded from this group. Their energy use, by convention, is not part of the final consumption of energy and is considered separately as energy industries own use\n\n#### Transmission\n\nEnergy transmission refers to the process of transporting electrical energy, typically at high voltages, from power generation sources to substations, and then onward to distribution networks. It's a crucial part of the electrical power grid, ensuring that electricity generated at power plants can be delivered to where it is needed.\n\n#### Distribution\n\nThe process of delivering energy, primarily electricity, from generation sources to end-users\n\n#### Coal mines\n\nPlants extracting coal through underground or open-cast mining. In addition to the extraction activity itself, the operation of coal mines also includes operations such as grading, cleaning, compressing, etc., leading to a marketable product.\n\n#### Coke ovens\n\nLarge ovens within which coke oven coke, coke oven gas and coal tars are produced by high temperature carbonization of coking coal.\n\n#### Coal liquefaction plants\n\nPlants where coal is used as a feedstock to produce liquid fuels by hydrogenation or carbonization. They are also known as coal to liquid (CTL) plants.\n\n#### Brown coal briquette plants\n\nPlants manufacturing brown coal briquettes (BKB).\n\n#### Gas works (and other conversion to gases)\n\nPlants manufacturing gases for distribution to the public either directly or after blending with natural gas. Note that the gases are collectively referred to as “gas works gas and other manufactured gases for distribution”; short name—gas works gas. Some gas works may produce coke, as well as gas.\n\n#### Gas separation plants:\n\nPlants involved in the separation of associated gas from crude oil, and/or the separation of condensate, water, impurities and natural gas liquids from natural gas. In addition to the above, the activities of these plants may also involve fractionation of the recovered natural gas liquids.\n\n#### Gas-to-liquids (GTL) plants\n\nPlants in which natural gas is used as a feedstock for the production of liquid fuels. The liquid fuels are usually used as vehicle fuels. Note that the GTL plants are quite different from liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants, which convert gaseous natural gas into liquid natural gas.\n\n#### LNG plants/regasification plants\n\nPlants for carrying out liquefaction and/or regasification of natural gas for the purpose of transport. This activity can be carried out on or off the actual point of production.\n\n#### Oil and gas extraction\n\nActivities of extracting crude oil, mining and extracting oil from oil shale and oil sands, extracting natural gas and recovery of natural gas liquids. This includes overall activities of operating and/or developing oil and gas field properties, including\n\nsuch activities as drilling, completing and equipping wells, operating separators, emulsion breakers, desilting equipment and field gathering lines for crude petroleum and all other activities in the preparation of oil and gas up to the point of shipment from the producing site.\n\n#### Oil refineries\n\nPlants that transform crude oil and other hydrocarbons (together with additives, feedstocks and natural gas liquids) into finished oil products. Typical finished products are liquefied petroleum gases, naphtha, motor gasoline, gas oils, aviation fuels and other kerosene, and fuel oils.\n\n#### Charcoal plants\n\nPlants in which wood, or other vegetal matter is carbonized through slow pyrolysis to produce charcoal.\n\n#### Biogas production plants\n\nPlants for capturing and/or manufacturing biogases. Biogases arise from the anaerobic fermentation of biomass. They can be derived from several sources, including landfills, sewage sludge and agricultural residues. They also include synthesis gas produced from biomass.\n\n#### Nuclear fuel extraction and fuel processing plants\n\nPlants involved in the mining of ores are chiefly valued for their uranium and thorium content, the concentration of such ores, the production of yellowcake, the enrichment of uranium and thorium ores, and/or the production of fuel elements for nuclear reactors.\n\n#### Other energy industry not elsewhere specified\n\nThis is a residual category that refers to any energy industry not covered elsewhere in the list above. One example is the extraction of peat for energy purposes.\n\n#### Other energy producers\n\n**E**conomic units (including households) that choose, or are forced by circumstance, to produce energy for their own consumption and/or to supply energy to other units, but for which energy production is not their principal activity. These units are engaged in the production, transformation and transmission/distribution of energy as a secondary and/or ancillary activity. This means that the “energy” output generated by these activities and measured in terms of value added does not exceed that of the principal activity of the unit. In the case of ancillary activities, the activities are carried out to support the principal and secondary activity of the unit.\n\n#### Production\n\nThe capture, extraction or manufacture of fuels or energy in forms that are ready for general use. In energy statistics, two types of production are distinguished, primary and secondary.\n\n●             Primary production is the capture or extraction of fuels or energy from natural energy flows, the biosphere and natural reserves of fossil fuels within the national territory in a form suitable for use. Inert matter removed from the extracted fuels and quantities reinjected, flared or vented are **not** included. The resulting products are referred to as “primary” products.\n\n●             Secondary production is the manufacture of energy products through the process of transformation of other fuels or energy, whether primary or secondary. The quantities of secondary fuels reported as production include quantities lost through venting and flaring during and after production.\n\n#### Imports of energy products\n\nAll fuel and other energy products entering the national territory. Goods simply being transported through a country (goods in transit) and goods temporarily admitted are excluded, while re-imports (i.e. domestic goods exported but subsequently readmitted) are included. The bunkering of fuel outside the reference territory by national merchant ships and civil aircraft engaged in international travel is also excluded from imports. Note that the country of origin of energy products should be recorded, where possible, as the country from which goods were imported, but not a transit country.\n\n#### Exports of energy products\n\nAll fuel and other energy products leaving the national territory. Goods simply being transported through a country (goods in transit) and goods temporarily withdrawn are excluded, while re-exports (i.e. foreign goods exported in the same state as previously imported) are included. Also excluded are quantities of fuels delivered for use by merchant ships (including passenger ships) and civil aircraft of all nationalities during international transport of goods and passengers. Note that the country of destination of energy products (i.e. the country of the last known destination as it is known at the time of exportation) should be recorded as a country to which these products are exported to, but not a transit country.\n\nIt should be noted that the definitions of imports and exports used in energy statistics are those adopted by international merchandise trade statistics for a system of recording known as the general trade system, that is, all energy products entering and leaving the national territory of a country and which add to or are subtracted from the stock of material resources of a country are recorded as energy imports and exports, except for the bunkering of international fleet, which is excluded from trade figures. It should also be noted that, in energy balances, imports and exports exclude nuclear fuels as these are not within the scope of energy balances.\n\n#### International marine bunkers\n\nQuantities of fuels delivered to merchant ships (including passenger ships) of any nationality for consumption during international voyages transporting goods or passengers. International voyages take place when the ports of departure and arrival are in different national territories. Fuels delivered for consumption by ships during domestic transportation, fishing or military uses are not included here, but are considered part of final consumption of energy (see para. 5.94 for domestic navigation). For the purposes of energy statistics, international marine bunkers are not included in exports; they are recorded separately due to their importance, e.g. for the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n#### International aviation bunkers\n\nQuantities of fuels delivered to civil aircraft of any nationality for consumption during international flights transporting goods or passengers. International flights take place when the ports of departure and arrival are in different national territories. Fuels delivered for consumption by aircraft undertaking domestic or military flights are not included here, but are considered part of final consumption of energy. For the purposes of energy statistics, international aviation bunkers are not included in exports; they are recorded separately due to their importance, e.g. for the estimation of greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n#### Stock changes\n\nFor the purposes of energy statistics, stocks are quantities of energy products that are held on the national territory and can be used to: (a) maintain service under conditions where supply and demand are variable in their timing or amount due to normal market fluctuations, or (b) supplement supply in the case of a supply disruption.Stocks used to manage a supply disruption may be called ”strategic” or “emergency” stocks and are often held separately from stocks designed to meet normal market fluctuations, but both are considered here. Stock changes are defined as the increase (stock build) or decrease (stock draw) in the quantity of stocks over the reporting period and thus are calculated as a difference between the closing and opening stocks.\n\n#### Transfers\n\nEssentially statistical devices to overcome practical classification and presentation issues resulting from changes in use or identity of a product. Transfers comprise products transferred and interproduct transfers. Products transferred refers to the reclassification (renaming) of products, which, for example, is necessary when finished oil products are used as feedstock in refineries. Interproduct transfers refer to the movements of fuels between product categories because of reclassification of a product that no longer meets its original specification. For example, aviation turbine fuel that has deteriorated or has been spoiled may be reclassified as heating kerosene.\n\n#### Transformation\n\nThe process where part or all of the energy content of a product entering a process moves from this product to one or more different products leaving the process (e.g., from coking coal to coke, from crude oil to oil products, or from fuel oil to electricity) (see section D.2 for further discussion).\n\n#### Losses\n\nLosses during the transmission, distribution and transport of fuels, heat and electricity. Losses also include venting and flaring of manufactured gases, losses of geothermal heat after production and pilferage of fuels or electricity. However, production of secondary gases includes quantities subsequently vented or flared. This ensures that a balance can be constructed between the use of the primary fuels from which the gases are derived and the production of the gases.\n\n#### Energy industries own use\n\nThe consumption of fuels and energy for the direct support of the production and preparation for use of fuels and energy, except heat not sold. As such, it covers not only own use by energy industries as defined in para. 5.23, but also by other energy producers. Quantities of fuels transformed into other fuels or energy are not included here, but within transformation; neither are quantities used within parts of the energy industry not directly involved in the activities listed in the definition.\n\nThese quantities are reported within final consumption.\n\n#### Non-energy use\n\nThe use of energy products as raw materials for the manufacture of products outside the scope of SIEC, as well as for direct uses that do not involve using the products as a source of energy, nor as a transformation input. Examples are lubrication, sealing, preservation, road surfacing and use as a solvent.\n\nFinal consumption refers to all fuel and energy delivered to users for both their energy and non-energy uses, and which do not involve a transformation process.\n\n#### Installation\n\nThe whole of any plant or equipment under one ownership designed for the supply or use of electrical energy.\n\n#### Public Lamp\n\nAn electric lamp used for the lighting of a street or a public place.\n\n#### Energy to GDP Ratio\n\nThe total value of energy produced as a proportion of the national GDP.\n\n#### Electricity/Energy Loss\n\nLosses are those that occur during the transmission, distribution and transport of fuels, electricity and heat.

It is sometimes expressed as weight per unit area of land or per unit volume of water.\n\n##### Capacity at peak\n\nThe available capacity of an installation at peak period is the maximum power at which it can be operated under the prevailing conditions at the time, assuming no external constraints. It depends on the technical state of the equipment and its ability to operate, and may differ from the Net maximum capacity due to lack of water for hydro capacity, plant maintenance, unanticipated shutdown, or other outages at the time of peak load\n\n##### Charcoal\n\nCovers the solid residue of the destructive distillation and pyrolysis of wood and other vegetal material. Since charcoal is a secondary product, its treatment is slightly different from that of the other primary biofuels. Production of charcoal (an output in the transformation process) is offset by the inputs of primary biofuels into the charcoal production process. The losses from this process are included in the transformation processes. Other supply (e.g. trade and stock changes) as well as consumption are aggregated directly with the primary biofuels. In some countries, only primary biofuels are reported.\n\n##### Coal and coal products\n\nCOAL (For balances only.) This is the sum of all primary coals (including peat, peat products or oil shale and oil sands) and all derived coal products (cokes, gases, tars, briquettes etc.).\n\n##### Coal transformation\n\nCoal transformation contains losses in transformation of coal from primary to secondary and from secondary to tertiary fuels (hard coal to coke, coke to blast furnace gas, lignite to BKB, etc.).\n\n##### Air Mass\n\nA large amount of air that has the same properties (temperature, water vapor, and stability).\n\n##### Dekad\n\nPeriod of ten consecutive days, sometimes used in the study of meteorological elements.\n\n##### Dew point\n\nThe temperature to which air must be cooled to create a cloud (or rain).\n\n##### Domestic\n\nIncludes fuels delivered to vessels of all flags not engaged in international navigation (see international marine bunkers). The domestic/international split should be determined on the basis of port of departure and port of arrival and not by the flag or nationality of the ship. Note that this may include journeys of considerable length between two ports in a country (e.g. San Francisco to Honolulu). Fuel used for ocean, coastal and inland fishing and military consumption are excluded.\n\n##### Domestic aviation\n\nIncludes deliveries of aviation fuels to aircraft for domestic aviation - commercial, private, agricultural, etc. It includes use for purposes other than flying, e.g. bench testing of engines, but not airline use of fuel for road transport. The domestic/international split should be determined on the basis of departure and landing locations and not by the nationality of the airline. Note that this may include journeys of considerable length between two airports in a country (e.g. San Francisco to Honolulu). For many countries this incorrectly includes fuel used by domestically owned carriers for outbound international traffic.\n\n##### Electricity output in GWh\n\nShows the total number of GWh generated by thermal power plants separated into electricity plants and CHP plants. Electricity production for hydro pumped storage is also given separately for main activity producers and auto producers.\n\n##### Electricity Regulatory Index\n\nLevel of development of regulatory governance and substance as well as impact of regulation on consumer satisfaction, monitoring and assessment of utility performance. Regulatory governance in this case refers to institutional design and structure of the regulatory authority that enables it to perform its functions as an independent regulator; also defined as the institutional and legal design of the regulatory system that defines the framework within which decisions are made by the regulator. Regulatory substance refers to the attributes of regulation linked to the actual actions or decisions of regulators that affect the performance of the regulated industry; the practical operation of regulatory practices and processes that have direct impact on regulatory outcomes. Whilst the regulatory outcomes refers to the impact of regulator’s decisions, actions and activities on the regulated sector, as well as the entire sector in general.\n\n##### Energy industry own use\n\nEnergy industry own use contains the primary and secondary energy consumed by transformation industries for heating, pumping, traction, and lighting purposes. These quantities are shown as negative figures. Included here are, for example, own use of energy in coal mines, own consumption in power plants (which includes net electricity consumed for pumped storage) and energy used for oil and gas extraction.\n\n##### Fuel oil (Residual)\n\nFuel oil defines oils that make up the distillation residue. It comprises all residual (heavy) fuel oils, including those obtained by blending. Its kinematic viscosity is above 10 CST at 80ºC. The flash point is always above 50ºC and the density is always higher than 0.90 kg/l. - Low-sulphur content: Heavy fuel oil with sulphur content lower than 1%.\n\n##### High-sulphur content\n\nHeavy fuel oil with sulphur content of 1% or higher.\n\n##### Fuelwood, wood residues and byproducts\n\nFuelwood or firewood (in log, brushwood, pellet or chip form) obtained from natural or managed forests or isolated trees.

Additives can be included to improve fuel stability and combustibility.\n\n##### Gas/diesel oil\n\nGas/diesel oil includes heavy gas oils. Gas oils are obtained from the lowest fraction from atmospheric distillation of crude oil, while heavy gas oils are obtained by vacuum re-distillation of the residual from atmospheric distillation. Gas/diesel oil distils between 180ºC and 380ºC. Several grades are available depending on uses: diesel oil for diesel compression ignition (cars, trucks, marine, etc.), light heating oil for industrial and commercial uses, and other gas oil including heavy gas oils which distil between 380ºC and 540ºC and which are used as petrochemical feedstocks.\n\n##### Greenhouse gas\n\nGreenhouse gases are those gaseous constituents of the atmosphere, both natural and anthropogenic, that absorb and emit radiation at specific wavelengths within the spectrum of terrestrial radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface, the atmosphere itself, and by clouds. This property causes the greenhouse effect. Water vapour (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH4) and ozone (O3) are the primary greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere. Moreover, there are a number of entirely human-made greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as the halocarbons and other chlorine- and bromine-containing substances, dealt with under the Montreal Protocol. Beside CO2, N2O and CH4, the Kyoto Protocol deals with the greenhouse gases sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and perfluorocarbons (PFCs).\n\n##### Hail\n\nPrecipitation of either transparent, or partly or completely opaque particles of ice (hailstones), usually spheroidal, conical or irregular in form and of diameter very generally between 5 and 50 millimetres, which falls from a cloud either separately or agglomerated into irregular lumps.\n\n##### Halocarbons\n\nA collective term for the group of partially halogenated organic species, which includes the chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), halons, methyl chloride and methyl bromide.

The most relevant types of assets used for R&D for which capital R&D expenditures should be compiled are:\n\na.   Land and buildings\n\nb.   Machinery and equipment\n\nc.    Capitalised computer software\n\nd.   Other intellectual property products.\n\n### Capitalised computer software (in capital R&D expenditures)\n\nThis includes the costs of computer software that is used in the performance of R&D for more than one year. It includes longterm licences or the acquisition of separately identifiable computer software, including programme descriptions and supporting materials for both systems and applications software. The production costs (e.g. labour and materials) of internally produced software should be reported. Software from external vendors may be obtained through the outright purchase of rights or licences to use. Software used or licensed for one year or less should be reported under current expenditures.\n\n### Contracted-out (external) R&D\n\nAny creative work undertaken to increase the stock of knowledge for developing innovations but performed by other firms (including other firms or subsidiaries within the group) or by public or private research organizations and purchased by the firm.\n\n### Cooperation for innovation activities\n\nActive participation in joint innovation projects with other organizations. Pure contracting out of work, where there is no active collaboration, is not regarded as cooperation.\n\n### Current R&D expenditures\n\nThese are composed of labour costs and other current costs (including for external R&D personnel) used in R&D. Services and items (including equipment) used and consumed within one year are current expenditures. Annual fees or rents for the use of fixed assets should be included in current expenditures.\n\n### Degree of novelty - new to the firm\n\nImplementation by a firm of a new or significantly improved good or service that was already available from its competitors in the market. A product, process, marketing method or organizational method may already have been implemented by other firms, but if it is new to the firm, then it is an innovation for that firm.\n\n### Degree of novelty - new to the market\n\nImplementation of a new or significantly improved good or service by a firm on its market before its competitors. The geographical scope of new to the market is subject to the firm’s own view of its operating market and may include both domestic and international firms.\n\n### Degree of novelty - new to the world\n\nInnovation is new to the world when the firm is the first to implement the innovation for all markets and industries, domestic and international. New to the world therefore implies a qualitatively greater degree of novelty than new to the market.\n\n### Engineering and technology (for R&D data)\n\nEngineering and technology include: civil engineering; electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering; mechanical engineering; chemical engineering; materials engineering; medical engineering; environmental engineering; environmental biotechnology; industrial biotechnology; nano-technology; and other engineering and technologies.\n\n### Exchange funds for R&D\n\nExchange funds for R&D are funding flows from one statistical unit to another statistical unit in return for the performance of R&D and the delivery of relevant R&D outcomes. The unit funding the work incurs a delivery risk associated with the uncertainty of the project. Examples of exchange funds activities include R&D purchases (sales from the perspective of the performer), R&D outsourcing and contributions in the context of collaborative R&D agreements.\n\n### Experimental development\n\nExperimental development is systematic work, drawing on knowledge gained from research and practical experience and producing additional knowledge, which is directed to producing new products or processes or to improving existing products or processes.\n\n### External R&D funds\n\nExternal R&D funds are the amount of money spent on R&D that originate outside the control of a reporting unit.\n\n### External R&D personnel\n\nExternal R&D personnel (or contributors) are independent (self-employed) or dependent (employee) workers fully integrated into a statistical unit’s R&D projects without formally being persons employed by the same R&D performing statistical unit.\n\n### Extramural R&D\n\nAny R&D performed outside of the statistical unit about which information is being reported; its “funds for extramural R&D” should include only internal funds (not from external sources) provided to an outside unit for R&D performance including both where there is an expected compensatory delivery of R&D (exchange or purchase) and where no compensatory delivery is expected (transfer or grant). It may also be noted that such funds for extramural R&D often will include payments for costs other than for R&D, such as cost elements covering depreciation costs, performer profit, delivery charges, etc.\n\nFields of research and development (FORD) The fields of research and development (FORD) classification is used to classify R&D units and resources by fields of enquiry, namely, broad knowledge domains based primarily on the content of the R&D subject matter. The main fields of R&D are:\n\na.     Natural sciences\n\nb.     Engineering and technology\n\nc.      Medical and health sciences\n\nd.     Agricultural and veterinary sciences\n\ne.     Social sciences\n\nf.       Humanities and the arts.\n\n### Firms with only abandoned or ongoing innovation activities\n\nFirms that did not implement innovations but had abandoned or ongoing innovation activities to develop them. Unless otherwise specified, the term covers product or process innovation, regardless of organizational or marketing innovation.\n\n### Full-time equivalent (FTE) of R&D personnel \n\nThis is defined as the ratio of working hours actually spent on R&D during a specific reference period (usually a calendar year) divided by the total number of hours conventionally worked in the same period by an individual or by a group. In other words, one full-time equivalent may be thought of as one person-year. Therefore, it is measured by combining two variables: actual involvement in R&D activities and formal engagement on the basis of normative/statutory working hours. FTE is considered to be a true measure of the volume of R&D and also the main R&D personnel statistic for international comparisons.\n\n### GERD as a percentage of GDP \n\nGross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) as a percentage of GDP is the total intramural expenditure on R&D performed in the national territory during a specific reference period expressed as a percentage of GDP of the national territory.\n\n### GERD by fields of research and development\n\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period, broken down by the fields of research and development. The fields included are:\n\na.    Natural sciences\n\nb.    Engineering and technology\n\nc.    Medical and health sciences\n\nd.    Agricultural and veterinary sciences\n\ne.     Social sciences\n\nf.      Humanities and the arts.\n\n### GERD by sector of performance\n\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period, broken down by the institutions corresponding to eac h sector (business enterprise, government, higher education and private non-profit organizations), independent of the source of funds.\n\n### GERD by source of funds\n\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period, broken down by current costs (labour costs and other current costs) and capital expenditure (land and buildings, machinery and equipment, capitalised computer software and other intellectual property products).\n\n### GERD by type of R&D activity\n\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period, broken down by basic research, applied research and experimental development.\n\n### GERD in local currency\n\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period and reported in current national currency (i.e. expenditure at current prices in national currency).\n\n### GERD in Purchasing Power Parities (PPPs)\n\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period, expressed in Purchasing Power Parity dollars.\n\n### GERD per capita\n\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period per inhabitant.\n\n### GERD per researcher\n\nTotal intramural expenditure on R&D performed during a specific reference period per researcher.\n\n### Government budget allocations for R&D (GBARD)\n\nIt encompasses all spending allocations met from sources of government revenue foreseen within the budget, such as taxation. Spending allocations by extra-budgetary government entities are only within the scope to the extent that their funds are allocated through the budgetary process. Likewise, R&D financing by public corporations is outside the scope of GBARD statistics, as it is based on funds raised within the market and outside the budgetary process. Only in the exceptional case of budgetary provisions for R&D to be carried out or distributed from public corporations should this be counted as part of GBARD.\n\n### Government expenditure on R&D (GOVERD)\n\nIt represents the component of GERD incurred by units belonging to the Government sector (see the definition of Government sector). It is the measure of expenditures on intramural R&D within the Government sector during a specific reference period.\n\nGovernment sector (for R&D data) In the context of R&D statistics, the Government sector consists of the following groups of resident institutional units\n\na.     All units of central (federal), regional (state) or local (municipal) government, including social security funds, except those units that provide higher education services or fit the description of higher education institutions (see the definition of Higher education sector).\n\nb.     All non-market NPIs that are controlled by government units that are not part of the Higher education sector.\n\nc.      This sector does not include public corporations, even when all the equity of such corporations is owned by government units. Public enterprises are included in the Business enterprise sector.\n\n### Government tax relief for R&D expenditures (GTARD)\n\nIt describes tax relief provisions that apply to taxpayers strictly as a result of their engagement in R&D performance and/or funding activities, relative to a normal or baseline tax structure.\n\n### Gross domestic expenditure on R&D (GERD) \n\nIt is total intramural expenditure on R&D performed in the national territory during a specific reference period.\n\n### Gross national expenditure on R&D (GNERD)\n\nIt comprises total expenditure on R&D financed by a country’s institutions regardless of where the R&D is performed. As such, it includes R&D performed in the “rest of the world” that is financed by national institutions or residents; it excludes R&D performed within a country that is funded from institutions outside of the national territory (that is, from institutions that are part of the “rest of the world”). GNERD is constructed by adding the domestically financed intramural expenditures of each performing sector plus the R&D performed in the “rest of the world” that is financed by domestic funding sectors.\n\n### Grossed up results\n\nResults of the survey extrapolated to the whole target population. Sample survey data represent units in the sample only. Therefore, the sample estimates need to be inflated to represent the whole population of interest. Estimation is the means by which this inflation occurs, also referred to as “grossing up”. Hampering factors for innovation activities Innovation activity may be hampered by a number of factors. There may be reasons for not starting innovation activities at all; there may be factors that slow innovation activities or affect them negatively. These hampering factors include: economic factors, such as high costs or lack of demand; enterprise factors, such as lack of skilled personnel or knowledge; and legal factors, such as regulations or tax rules. Two indicators are calculated:\n\na.     the percentage of innovation-active firms for which hampering factors were highly important and\n\nb.     the percentage of non-innovative firms for which hampering factors were highly important.\n\n### Headcount (HC) of R&D personnel \n\nThe total number of individuals contributing to intramural R&D, at the level of a statistical unit or at an aggregate level, during a specific reference period (usually a calendar year). That means headcount data reflect the total number of persons who are mainly or partially employed in R&D. The use of HCs is mostly recommended in terms of exploring, usually in percentage terms, the characteristics of R&D personnel.\n\n### Higher education expenditure on R&D (HERD)\n\nRepresents the component of GERD incurred by units belonging to the Higher education sector (see the definition of Higher education sector). It is the measure of intramural R&D expenditures within the Higher education sector during a specific period.\n\nHigher education sector (for R&D data) In the context of R&D statistics, the Higher education sector comprises:\n\na.     All universities, colleges of technology and other institutions providing formal tertiary education programmes (i.e. ISCED levels 5, 6, 7, or 8), whatever their source of finance or legal status.\n\nb.     All research institutes, centres, experimental stations and clinics that have their R&D activities under the direct control of, or are administered by, tertiary education institutions.\n\n### Humanities and the arts (for R&D data)\n\nHumanities and the arts include: history and archaeology; languages and literature; philosophy, ethics and religion; art (arts, history of arts, performing arts, music); and other humanities.\n\n### In-house R&D\n\nAny creative work undertaken within the firm to increase the stock of knowledge for developing innovations (see the Frascati Manual).\n\n### Innovation\n\nImplementation of a new or significantly improved product (good or service), or process, or a new marketing method, or a new organizational method. The minimum requirement for an innovation is that the product, process, marketing method or organizational method must be new (or significantly improved in the case of product or process) to the firm.\n\n### Innovation activities\n\nAll scientific, technological, organizational, financial, and commercial steps which actually lead, or are intended to lead, to the implementation of innovations. Some innovation activities are themselves innovative, others are not novel activities but are necessary for the implementation of innovations. Innovation activities also include R&D that is not directly related to the development of a specific innovation. The indicator is calculated as a percentage.\n\n### Innovation-active firms\n\nFirms that have had innovation activities during the observation period of the innovation survey, including those with ongoing and abandoned activities. In other words, firms that have had innovation activities during the observation period, regardless of whether the activity resulted in the implementation of an innovation, are innovation-active. Unless otherwise specified, the term covers product or process innovation, regardless of organizational or marketing innovation. The indicator is calculated as a percentage.\n\n### Innovative firms\n\nAre firms that implemented an innovation. Unless otherwise specified, the term is used to refer to product or process innovative firms, which are also known as product or process innovators. The indicator is calculated as a percentage.\n\n### Internal R&D funds\n\nThe amount of money spent on R&D that originate within the control of and are used for R&D at the discretion of a reporting statistical unit. Internal R&D funds do not include R&D funds received from other statistical units explicitly for intramural R&D.\n\n### Internal R&D personnel\n\nPersons employed by the statistical unit who contribute to the unit’s intramural R&D activities.\n\n### Intramural R&D expenditures\n\nAll current expenditures plus gross fixed capital expenditures for R&D performed within a statistical unit during a specific reference period, whatever the source of funds. Intramural R&D expenditure is synonymous with the performance of R&D within a statistical unit. The aggregation of intramural R&D for all units within a sector is synonymous with the performance of R&D within a sector of the economy; the summation of intramural R&D for all sectors is synonymous with the performance of R&D for the entire economy (GERD).\n\n### Labour costs (in current R&D expenditures)\n\nLabour costs, or compensation of employed personnel, comprise annual wages and salaries and all associated costs or fringe benefits, such as bonus payments, stock options, holiday pay, contributions to pension funds. The concept of labour costs also includes other social security payments and payroll taxes.\n\n### Land and buildings (in capital R&D expenditures)\n\nInclude land acquired for R&D use (e.g. testing grounds, sites for laboratories and pilot plants) and buildings constructed or purchased for R&D use, including major improvements, modifications and repairs.\n\n### Level of formal qualification (for R&D data)\n\nThe International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) provides the basis for classifying R&D personnel by formal qualification. Five classes are recommended for the purposes of R&D statistics. They are defined exclusively by level of education, regardless of the field in which personnel are qualified.\n\na.     Doctoral or equivalent level: Programmes at ISCED level 8, or doctoral or equivalent level, are designed primarily to lead to an advanced research qualification. Programmes at this level are devoted to advanced study and original research and are typically offered only by research-oriented tertiary educational institutions such as universities. Doctoral programmes exist in both academic and professional fields.\n\nb.     Master’s or equivalent level: Programmes at level, or Master’s or equivalent level, are often designed to provide participants with advanced academic and/or professional knowledge, skills and competencies, leading to a second degree or equivalent qualification. Programmes at this level may have a substantial research component but do not yet lead to the award of a doctoral qualification. Typically, programmes at this level are theoretically-based but may include practical components and are informed by state of the art research and/or best professional practice. They are traditionally offered by universities and other tertiary educational institutions.\n\nc.      Bachelor’s or equivalent level: Programmes level, Bachelor’s or equivalent level, are often designed to provide participants with intermediate academic and/or professional knowledge, skills and competencies, leading to a first degree or equivalent qualification. Programmes at this level are typically theoretically-based but may include practical components and are informed by state of the art research and/or best professional practice. They are traditionally offered by universities and equivalent tertiary educational institutions. First degree programmes at this level typically have a duration of three to four years of full-time study at the tertiary level.\n\nd.     Short-cycle tertiary education: Programmes at level, or short-cycle tertiary education, are often designed to provide participants with professional knowledge, skills and competencies. Typically, they are practically based, occupationally-specific and prepare students to enter the labour market. However, these programmes may also provide a pathway to other tertiary education programmes.\n\ne.     This includes post-secondary non-tertiary education, upper secondary education and below. Post-secondary non-tertiary education: Post-secondary non-tertiary education provides learning and educational activities building on secondary education preparing for both labour market entry as well as tertiary education. It typically targets students who have completed upper secondary but who want to increase their opportunities either to enter the labour market or to progress to tertiary education. Programmes are often not significantly more advanced than those at upper secondary as they typically serve to broaden rather than deepen knowledge, skills and competencies. It therefore aims at learning below the high level of complexity characteristic of tertiary education. Upper secondary education: Programmes at this level, or ‘upper secondary’ education, are typically designed to complete secondary education in preparation for tertiary education, or to provide skills relevant to employment, or both. Programmes at this level offer students more varied, specialised and in-depth instruction than programmes at lower secondary education. They are more differentiated, with an increased range of options and streams available.\n\n### Machinery and equipment (in capital R&D expenditures)\n\nCover major (i.e. capitalised) machinery and equipment acquired for use in the performance of R&D.\n\n### Market introduction of innovations\n\nActivities for the market introduction of product innovations, including market research, market tests and launch advertising.\n\n### Marketing innovation\n\nImplementation of a new marketing method involving significant changes in product design or packaging, product placement, product promotion or pricing.\n\n### Marketing innovators\n\nFirms that implemented marketing innovation.\n\n### Medical and health sciences (for R&D data)\n\nMedical and health sciences include: basic medicine; clinical medicine; health sciences; medical biotechnology; and other medical sciences.\n\n### Natural sciences (for R&D data)\n\nInclude: mathematics; computer and information sciences; physical sciences; chemical sciences; earth and related environmental sciences; biological sciences; and other natural sciences.\n\n### Natural sciences and engineering (for R&D data)\n\nNatural sciences and engineering include:\n\na.       Natural sciences: mathematics; computer and information sciences; physical sciences; chemical sciences; earth and related environmental sciences; biological sciences; other natural sciences;\n\nb.       Engineering and technology: civil engineering; electrical engineering, electronic engineering, information engineering; mechanical engineering; chemical engineering; materials engineering; medical engineering; environmental engineering; environmental biotechnology; industrial biotechnology; nano-technology; and other engineering and technologies;\n\nc.        Medical and health sciences: basic medicine; clinical medicine; health sciences; medical biotechnology; and other medical sciences;\n\nd.       Agricultural and veterinary sciences: agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; animal and dairy science; veterinary science; agricultural biotechnology; and other agricultural sciences.\n\n### Non-innovative firms\n\nFirms without any kind of innovation activity.

Other current costs include royalties or licences for the use of patents and other intellectual property rights, the lease of capital goods (machinery and equipment, etc.) and the rental of buildings to support R&D performed by the statistical unit in the reference year. The category of other current R&D costs also includes costs for computer software that is used in the performance of R&D for one year or less; costs associated with engaging persons such as on-site consultants who are not employed in the statistical unit but provide direct services that are integrated into the statistical unit’s R&D activities; cost for doctoral and master’s students not employed by the statistical unit (e.g. receiving research grant or scholarship tracked by or through the statistical unit); administrative and other overhead costs, i.e. office, information and telecommunications, utilities, insurance, and costs for indirect or ancillary services, i.e. storage; the use, cleaning, repair and maintenance of buildings and equipment; computer services; and the printing of R&D reports.\n\n### Other intellectual property products (in capital R&D expenditures)\n\nThese are costs for purchased patents, long-term licences or other intangible assets used in R&D, and which are in use for more than one year. Other intangibles that can be reported in a unit’s internal financial accounts, such as marketing assets or goodwill, should not be included.\n\n### Other preparations for product and process innovations\n\nThis includes other internal activities related to the development and implementation of product and process innovations that are not included in R&D. They include development activities that are either partially excluded as R&D (such as industrial design, engineering and set-up, and trial production) or fully excluded (such as patent and licence work, production start-up, and testing), and development activities for product or process innovations that do not meet the novelty requirement for R&D (i.e., they are new to the firm but not new to the market).\n\n### Other supporting staff\n\nThis includes skilled and unskilled craftsmen, and administrative, secretarial and clerical staff participating in R&D projects or directly associated with such projects.\n\n### Other supporting staff by sector of employment\n\nSkilled and unskilled craftsmen, and administrative, secretarial and clerical staff participating in R&D projects or directly associated with such projects, broken down by the sectors they are employed in (business enterprise, government, higher education and private non-profit organizations).\n\n### Performers of R&D\n\nThis consists of statistical units that undertake (i.e. perform) R&D in each of the main sectors covered: Business enterprise, Government, Higher education and Private non-profit.\n\n### Preparations for marketing innovations\n\nActivities related to the development and implementation of new marketing methods not previously used by a firm. They include the development and planning of new marketing methods and the work involved in their implementation. Activities related to marketing innovations include only those for developing and implementing new marketing methods, not expenditures for using these methods in daily business. This category also includes the acquisition of other external knowledge of machinery, equipment, and other capital goods and training that are specifically related to marketing innovations.\n\n### Preparations for organizational innovations\n\nActivities related to the development and planning of new organizational methods and the work involved in their implementation. This category also includes the acquisition of other external knowledge of machinery, equipment and other capital goods and training activities that are specifically related to organizational innovations.\n\n### Private non-profit expenditure on R&D (PNPERD)\n\nThus represents the component of GERD incurred by units belonging to the Private non-profit sector (see the definition of Private non-profit sector). It is the measure of intramural R&D expenditures within the Private non-profit sector during a specific reference period.\n\n### Process innovation\n\nImplementation of a new or significantly improved production or delivery method. This includes significant changes in techniques, equipment or software.\n\n### Product innovation\n\nImplementation of a good or service that is new or significantly improved with respect to its characteristics or intended uses.

This means that a given sum of money, when converted into US dollars at the PPP exchange rate (PPP dollars), will buy the same basket of goods and services in all countries. In other words, PPP is the rate of currency conversion which eliminates the differences in price levels among countries. Thus, comparisons between countries reflect only differences in the volume of goods and services purchased.\n\n### R&D coefficients\n\nThis is a tool for calculating / estimating the shares of personnel and expenditure data attributable to R&D. They are especially used for distributing total resources among research, teaching and other activities (including administration) in the Higher education sector. They can be used for the total expenditure or for parts of it, like public general university funds (GUF) or for personnel only.\n\nR&D functions classification of personnel d according to their R&D function, which may be researcher, technician or other support staff.\n\n### R&D personnel by sex \n\nThese are researchers, technicians and equivalent staff, and other supporting staff, broken down by sex (male and female).\n\n### Research and experimental development (R&D)\n\nThe creative and systematic work undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge including knowledge of humankind, culture and society – and to devise new applications of available knowledge. The term R&D covers three types of activity: basic research, applied research and experimental development. For an activity to be an R&D activity, it must satisfy five core criteria. The activity must be:\n\na.   Novel (to be aimed at new findings)\n\nb.   Creative (to be based on original, not obvious, concepts and hypotheses)\n\nc.    Uncertain (to be uncertain about the final outcome)\n\nd.   Systematic (to be planned and budgeted)\n\ne.   Transferable and/or reproducible (to lead to results that could be possibly reproduced).\n\n### Researchers\n\nThese are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge. They conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods.\n\n### Researchers by age\n\nThese are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) broken down by age. The age groups recommended are: under 25 years, 25-34 years, 35-44 years, 45-54 years, 55-64 years, and 65 years and more.\n\n### Researchers by fields of research and development\n\nThese are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) broken down by fields of research and development.\n\nThe fields included are:\n\na.    Natural sciences\n\nb.    Engineering and technology\n\nc.    Medical and health sciences\n\nd.    Agricultural and veterinary sciences\n\ne.    Social sciences\n\nf.     Humanities and the arts.\n\n### Researchers by formal qualification professionals\n\nEngaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) broken down by their formal level of qualification.\n\n### Researchers by sector of employment professionals\n\nEngaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) broken down by the sectors they are employed in (business enterprise, government, higher education and private non-profit organizations).\n\n### Researchers by seniority level professionals\n\nEngaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) broken down by the seniority levels. It is proposed to use the following classification of seniority grades/levels:\n\na.   Category A: The single highest grade/post at which research is normally conducted. Example: “Director of research” or “Full professor”.\n\nb.   Category B: Researchers working in positions not as senior as top position (A) but more senior than newly qualified doctoral graduates. Example: “Senior researcher” or “Principal investigator” or “Associate professor”.\n\nc.    Category C: The first grade/post into which a newly qualified doctoral graduate would normally be recruited. Examples: “Researcher” or “Investigator” or “Assistant professor” or “Post-doctoral fellow”.\n\nd.   Category D: Either doctoral students who are engaged as researchers, or researchers working in posts that do not normally require a doctorate degree. Examples: “Ph.D. students” or “Junior researchers” (without a Ph.D.). Master’s students who are counted as researchers would also fall under this category.\"\n\n### Researchers per million inhabitants\n\nThe number of professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) during a given year expressed as a proportion of a population of one million.\n\n### Researchers per thousand employment\n\nThe number of professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) during a given year expressed as a proportion of 1,000 employed people.\n\n### Researchers per thousand labour force\n\nThe number of professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge (who conduct research and improve or develop concepts, theories, models, techniques, instrumentation, software or operational methods) during a given year expressed as a proportion of a labour force of 1,000 people.\n\n### Rest of the world (for R&D data)\n\nIn the context of R&D statistics, the rest of the world (formerly referred to as ‘Abroad’) includes:\n\na.   All institutions and individuals without a location, place of production or premises within the economic territory on which or from which the unit engages and intends to continue engaging, either indefinitely or over a finite but long period of time, in economic activities and transactions on a significant scale;\n\nb.   All international organisations and supranational entities including facilities and operations within the country’s borders.\n\n### Social sciences (for R&D data)\n\nThis includes psychology and cognitive sciences; economics and business; education; sociology; law; political science; social and economic geography; media and communications; and other social sciences.\n\n### Social sciences and humanities (for R&D data)\n\nThese include social sciences: psychology and cognitive sciences; economics and business; education; sociology; law; political science; social and economic geography; media and communications; other social sciences; and- Humanities and the arts: history and archaeology; languages and literature; philosophy, ethics and religion; art (arts, history of arts, performing arts, music); and other humanities.\n\n### Source of R&D funds \n\nThis is the unit that provides the funds for R&D performance.

In broad terms, there are five main sources for R&D funding: Business enterprise, Government, Higher education, Private non-profit and the Rest of the world.\n\n### Sources of information for innovation activities\n\nsources that provided information for new innovation projects or contributed to the completion of existing innovation projects. They provide access to knowledge without the need to pay for the knowledge itself, although there may be marginal fees for access (membership in trade associations, attendance at conferences, subscriptions to journals). Open information sources do not provide access to knowledge embodied in machinery or equipment or the right to use knowledge protected by patents and other forms of intellectual property, although the knowledge behind the patent can be accessed through patent databases. Some open sources, such as attendance at fairs or exhibitions, can give access to some tacit knowledge through personal interaction with other participants.\n\n### Successful innovation activities\n\nThese are activities of a firm that resulted in the implementation of an innovation (though not necessarily commercially successful).\n\n### Technicians and equivalent staff \n\nThese are persons whose main tasks require technical knowledge and experience in one or more fields of engineering, the physical and life sciences, or the social sciences, humanities and the arts. They participate in R&D by performing scientific and technical tasks involving the application of concepts, operational methods and the use of research equipment, normally under the supervision of researchers.\n\n### Time-use surveys (for R&D data)\n\nThis is a statistical survey that aims to report data on how people spend their time. If the necessary R&D coefficients cannot be derived from other surveys or administrative data, time-use surveys are the recommended method to derive the necessary information for estimating the R&D component of full-time equivalents (FTEs) and expenditures.\n\n### Total R&D personnel\n\nin a statistical unit, these include all persons engaged directly in R&D, whether employed by the statistical unit or external contributors fully integrated into the statistical unit’s R&D activities, as well as those providing direct services for the R&D activities (such as R&D managers, administrators, technicians and clerical staff). Persons providing indirect support and ancillary services, such as canteen, maintenance, administrative and security staff, should be excluded, even though their wages and salaries are included as an overhead cost when measuring R&D expenditure. Two main groups of individuals who potentially contribute to the R&D activities can be identified in a statistical unit: ‘Internal R&D personnel’ and ‘external R&D personnel’. Both groups of R&D personnel are classified according to their R&D function: ‘Researchers’, ‘technicians’ and ‘other supporting staff’. (See the relevant definitions in this glossary).\n\n### Training for innovative activities\n\nThese are all the training (including external training) that is required for the development or implementation of product or process innovations.\n\n### Transfer R&D funds \n\nThese are funding flows from one statistical unit to another statistical unit to perform R&D that does not require any good or service in return and where the funder is not entitled to any significant rights on the outcome of the R&D it has funded. The unit that provides transfer funds for R&D may impose some conditions on the performer, such as periodic reporting, compliance with the activity or project description as agreed in the terms of the agreement, or even public dissemination of research outcomes. Examples of transfer funds include grants, debt forgiveness, philanthropy, crowd-funding and personal transfers such as gifts and GUF (by convention for international comparisons). To be included as R&D transfer funds, the funds should be intended by the originating source to be used for R&D. Normally, the R&D performer will retain most rights to the outcomes of the R&D, which explains the transfer nature of this R&D funding transaction.\n\n### Types of costs of R&D\n\nInclude individual current and capital cost categories for intramural R&D. Types of current costs include labour costs for internal R&D personnel and other current costs (for external R&D personnel, purchases of services, purchases of materials, and other costs not elsewhere classified. Types of capital costs include land and buildings, machinery and equipment, capitalised computer software and other intellectual property products.\n\n### Types of R&D\n\nThree types of R&D are considered under the term ‘R&D’: basic research, applied research and experimental development.\n\n### Types of R&D funds\n\nThese are the funds to cover the costs of R&D involving significant flows between units, sectors and countries. From the perspective of performance, R&D is conducted by the statistical unit with funds either from the statistical unit’s own sources (internal) or from sources outside of the statistical unit (external). From the perspective of funding, R&D funds pay for either the costs of R&D performance within the statistical unit (intramural) or the costs of R&D performance outside of the statistical unit (extramural). There can be a flow of R&D funds between statistical units either with (exchange) or without (transfer) compensatory return flows of R&D from the performer. See the relevant definitions (on ‘internal’ and ‘external’ sources of R&D funds, ‘intramural’ and ‘extramural’ R&D, and ‘exchange’ and ‘transfer’ categories of funds for R&D) in this glossary.\n\n## Economic statistics, n.e.c.\n\n# Environment Statistics\n\n## Environmental Conditions and Quality\n\nEnvironmental conditions and quality refer to the physical, chemical, biological, and socio-economic factors that characterize the environment and determine its ability to sustain life.

It assumes the conservation of natural assets for future growth and development.\n\n### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\n\nAlso known as the Global Goals, they are an intergovernmental set of development goals which were adopted by the United Nations member states in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people enjoy peace and prosperity.\n\n### Sustainable Development Goals, Targets and Indicators\n\nThe SDG includes 17 goals, 169 targets and 248 indicators. The goals set the aspiration of what the SDGs are trying to achieve. The 169 targets are the areas of change that need to be reached in order to achieve the 17 goals. Indicators are used to measure the progress on the target and goal.\n\n### Global SDG Indicator Framework\n\nA standardized set of 231 indicators adopted by the UN to monitor SDGs progress.      \n\n### Voluntary National Review (VNR)\n\nCountry-led assessments presented at the UN to report on SDGs implementation.\n\n### Data Revolution for Sustainable Development\n\nA global movement to improve data quality, timeliness, and inclusivity for better decisions.\n\n### SDG Dashboard\n\nA visual, interactive tool for tracking progress across the SDGs and indicators.      \n\n## Human Rights\n\nThe inalienable rights to which a person is entitled merely for being human. Human rights are built on underlying principles of universality, indivisibility, equality, participation, accountability and [non-discrimination](https://www.unhcr.org/glossary#non-discrimination), and are enshrined in international human rights law, rules of customary international law, national laws and other standards that define them and help to guarantee their full enjoyment.\n\nInherent claims to social arrangements that protect each and every person from abuses and deprivation that would prevent them from attaining their full potential.\n\n### Human Rights Mechanisms\n\nThe various human rights monitoring mechanisms of the United Nations system. These include UN Charter-based bodies (including the Human Rights Council, Universal Periodic Review and special procedures) and treaty-based bodies created under the international human rights treaties (known as treaty bodies).\n\n### Human Rights-Based Approach\n\nA conceptual framework underpinning human development and humanitarian action that is normatively based on international [human rights](https://www.unhcr.org/glossary#human-rights) standards and operationally directed to promoting and protecting human rights. A human rights-based approach identifies rights-holders and their entitlements and corresponding duty-bearers and their obligations, and works towards strengthening the capacities of rights-holders to make their claims and of duty-bearers to meet their obligations. It is not only about achieving human rights goals and outcomes, but also about achieving them through a participatory, inclusive, nondiscriminatory, transparent and responsive process.\n\n### International Bill of Human Rights\n\nDocuments that form the primary legal basis of United Nations activities to promote, protect and monitor [human rights](https://www.unhcr.org/glossary#human-rights) and fundamental freedoms. These include the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights(ICCPR).\n\n### Limitations on Human Rights\n\nLimitations placed by States on the exercise of certain [human rights](https://www.unhcr.org/glossary#human-rights) where they have valid reasons to do so, such as to protect the rights and freedoms of others, for national security, or to protect public health or morals. The burden falls upon States to prove that a limitation imposed upon the enjoyment of the right is legitimate.\n\n### Non-Derogable Rights\n\nThose human rights which cannot be subjected to limitations or suspensions under any conditions, including in times of public emergency. They include the right to life; the right not to be subjected to torture, or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; freedom from slavery and servitude; freedom of thought, conscience and religion. These rights are also known as peremptory norms of international law or jus cogens norms.\n\n### Non-Refoulement\n\nA core principle of international human rights and refugee law that prohibits States from returning individuals in any manner whatsoever (whether directly or indirectly) to territories where they may be at risk of persecution, torture, or other forms of serious or irreparable harm.\n\n### National Human Rights Institution (NHRI)\n\nA State institution established by Law or Constitution with a broad mandate to promote and protect human rights. NHRIs are independent institutions that function without interference from the State or any other stakeholders.\n\n### Conflict-Related Deaths\n\nThese are deaths for which there are reasonable grounds to believe that they resulted directly from acts of war and that the acts, decisions and/or purposes that caused these deaths were in furtherance of, or under the guise of armed conflict.\n\n### Journalists\n\nThese are individuals who observe, document, analyze and document events, statements, policies, and other developments that may impact society. Their primary role is to collect, verify, organize, and report  information in order to inform the public or specific sectors of society. This definition encompasses not only professional full-time reporters and analysts, but also media workers, support staff, community media practitioners, and citizen journalists who temporarily take on journalistic roles. It also includes bloggers and others who engage in self-publication through print, online platforms, or other media channels. Regardless of the medium or employment status, journalists share the common purpose of providing fact-based information and analysis to contribute to an informed society.\n\n### Trade Unionists\n\nIndividuals exercising their right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of their interests.\n\n### Trade Union\n\nAn association of workers organized to protect and promote their common interests.\n\n### Human Rights Defenders\n\nIndividuals who, alone or in association with others, exercise their rights to promote and strive for the protection and realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms at both national and international levels. This category may include certain journalists and trade unionists. While the term \"human rights advocate\" is often used synonymously, \"human rights defender\" is preferred as it aligns more closely with internationally agreed human rights standards and established practice.\n\n### Killing\n\nAny extrajudicial or unlawful execution carried out by State actors or by other actors with the State’s permission, support, or acquiescence, motivated by the victim or someone associated with the victim engaging in activities as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender; or committed while the victim was undertaking such activities. This also includes killings by individuals or groups not supported by the State when the act was motivated by the victim's engagement in such activities and/or was met with a lack of due diligence by the State in responding to the harm, with such inaction motivated by the victim’s or associate’s role. It also includes unlawful attacks and destruction in violation of international humanitarian law that result in or are intended to cause the victim’s death.\n\n### Enforced Disappearance\n\nThe arrest, detention, abduction, or any other form of deprivation of liberty of a person by State agents or by persons acting with the authorization, support, or acquiescence of the State, where such acts are motivated by the victim’s or an associate’s engagement in activities as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender. The act is followed by a refusal to acknowledge the deprivation of liberty or by concealment of the victim’s fate or whereabouts, placing them outside the protection of the law.\n\n### Torture\n\nAny act whereby severe physical or mental pain or suffering is intentionally inflicted on a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender for purposes such as obtaining information or a confession, punishing, intimidating, coercing them, or for reasons based on discrimination of any kind. This applies when the pain or suffering is inflicted by, or with the consent, instigation, or acquiescence of, a public official or someone acting in an official capacity.\n\n### Arbitrary Detention\n\nThe arrest or detention of a person that is not in accordance with national laws either because it lacks a legal basis or does not follow established legal procedures and is motivated by the victim’s or an associate’s engagement in activities as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender. It is considered arbitrary when it is inappropriate, unjust, unreasonable, or unnecessary under the circumstances.\n\n### Kidnapping\n\nThe unlawful detention, abduction, or confinement of a person without their consent by individuals or groups not acting with the State’s support or acquiescence, where the State fails to exercise due diligence in responding to the incident. Such failure is motivated by the victim’s or an associate’s engagement in activities as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender.\n\n### Other Harmful Acts\n\nOther actions by State actors or by individuals acting with the State’s permission, support, or acquiescence that cause or intend to cause harm, and that are motivated by the victim’s role as a journalist, trade unionist, or human rights defender.\n\n### Verified Cases\n\nReported cases that include a minimum set of relevant information about the individuals and circumstances involved, and have been reviewed by mandated bodies or mechanisms, which found reasonable grounds to believe that the individuals were victims of human rights violations or abuses.\n\n### Discrimination\n\nAny distinction, exclusion, restriction, or preference either direct or indirect based on prohibited grounds, with the intent or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment, or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis in the political, economic, social, cultural, or other public spheres.\n\n### Harassment\n\nA form of discrimination based on prohibited grounds, which may involve words, gestures, or actions that annoy, alarm, demean, intimidate, belittle, humiliate, or embarrass another person, or create a hostile or offensive environment. While often involving repeated behavior, harassment may also occur as a single incident.\n\n### Agent of Persecution\n\nPeople or entities responsible for acts or threats of persecution. These may include State Authorities or non-State actors.\n\n### Detention\n\nThe deprivation of liberty or confinement in a closed place from which an asylum-seeker cannot leave at will, including prisons or designated detention, reception, or holding centers.\n\n### Alternatives to Detention\n\nLegislation, policies, or practices that allow asylum-seekers to reside in the community under certain conditions or restrictions on movement while their protection claims are processed.\n\n### Asylum Seeker\n\nA general term for a person seeking international protection. In some countries, it has a legal meaning, referring to an individual who has applied for refugee or complementary protection status and is awaiting a final decision. It may also refer to individuals who intend to apply or who may be in need of such protection.\n\n### Displacement\n\nThe forced or compelled movement of individuals from their homes or habitual places of residence either within their country or across borders due to armed conflict, generalized violence, human rights violations, or natural or human-made disasters.\n\n### Forced Marriage\n\nA marriage in which one or both parties have not given their full and free consent.

Gender statistics are more than just statistics about women or sex-disaggregated data. They include:\n\n·       Sex-disaggregated data;\n\n·       Data pertaining specifically to women or men;\n\n·       Data capturing gender issues, even if they do not explicitly mention gender, sex, or women and men.\n\n### Gender\n\nGender is a socio-cultural construct that defines and determines the roles, responsibilities, entitlements, and limitations of women, men, girls, and boys in society. It influences their societal position and varies across time, space, and context. Gender refers to the roles and expectations assigned by society, not biology.\n\n### Sex\n\nSex refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that distinguish females and males. These characteristics are natural, unlike gender, which is socially constructed and shaped by historical, cultural, and relational contexts.\n\n### Gender Analysis\n\nGender analysis examines how differences in roles, responsibilities, needs, opportunities, and rights affect women, men, girls, and boys. It analyzes their constraints and the impacts of these differences to inform policies and programs. This analysis highlights gender gaps and supports equitable development planning.\n\n### Gender Relations\n\nThese are socially constructed relationships between women and men in a given cultural context. They differ from biological distinctions and influence power dynamics, access to resources, and social positioning.\n\n### Gender Issues\n\nGender issues refer to challenges, opportunities, and barriers affecting both women and men, girls and boys. They are not synonymous with women’s issues.\n\n### Gender-Aware Planning\n\nThis is the process of incorporating gender considerations into planning and development initiatives. It acknowledges that programs affect women/girls and men/boys differently. The use of sex-disaggregated data is essential in policymaking, planning, budgeting, and decision-making.\n\n### Gender Inequality\n\nGender inequality refers to unequal access to resources, opportunities, and benefits for women and men. It hinders individual development, national growth, and societal progress.\n\n### Gender Statistics\n\nGender statistics reflect the socio-cultural realities of women, men, girls, and boys. They include sex-disaggregated data and other statistics relevant to gender-related issues.\n\n### Sex-Disaggregated Data\n\nData categorized separately for males and females. This disaggregation is essential for identifying inequalities and conducting effective gender analysis.\n\n### Gender-Disaggregated Data\n\nData that are broken down by sex and other variables such as age, location, ethnicity, disability, socio-economic status, and education. These distinctions help reveal hidden inequalities.\n\n### Statistics on Women\n\nData focused exclusively on women, often used to highlight their situation. However, they do not allow for comparisons with men and cannot fully reveal gender gaps.\n\n### Gender Bias\n\nBias arising from decisions or assumptions based on gender, often favoring men or boys over women or girls.\n\n### Gender Stereotyping\n\nAssigning specific attributes, characteristics, or roles to individuals solely based on their gender. Stereotyping becomes harmful when it limits opportunities or choices, particularly in education, careers, or personal development.\n\n### Gender Equality\n\nThe condition in which women and men, girls and boys have equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities. Gender equality ensures that individuals can realize their full potential without discrimination based on gender.\n\n### Gender Indicators\n\nMeasures used to assess progress toward gender equality. These may be quantitative (e.g., statistics, figures) or qualitative (e.g., perceptions, experiences).\n\n### Gender Equity\n\nThe principle of fairness in treatment for women and men, accounting for different needs, interests, and experiences. It may require special measures to address historic or systemic disadvantages.\n\n### Gender Gap\n\nThe measurable difference between women and men in terms of access to opportunities, resources, and participation in various sectors.\n\n### Gender Disparities\n\nStatistical differences, often called gaps, between men and women that reflect unequal conditions or outcomes.\n\n### Gender Parity\n\nGender parity is a numerical measure that reflects relative equality in terms of the number and proportion of women and men, or girls and boys. It is commonly calculated as the ratio of female to male values for a given indicator. When the ratio is calculated as male to female instead, the term “sex ratio” is used rather than “gender parity.”\n\n### Gender Parity Index\n\nThe Gender Parity Index (GPI) measures the relative access to education of female and male students. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of females to the number of males enrolled at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of education.\n\n### Gender Development Index (GDI)\n\nThe GDI is a tool used to measure gender inequalities in the social, cultural, economic, and political spheres. It assesses gender gaps in human development across three key dimensions:\n\n1.       Health – measured by female and male life expectancy at birth;\n\n2.     Education – measured by female and male expected years of schooling for children and mean years of schooling for adults aged 25 and above;\n\n3.      Economic resources – measured by estimated earned income for females and males.\n\n### Gender Blindness\n\nGender blindness refers to the failure to recognize that the roles and responsibilities of women/girls and men/boys are socially and culturally constructed. Gender-blind studies, programs, projects, policies, and attitudes maintain the status quo, overlooking diverse needs and roles, and therefore fail to transform unequal gender relations.\n\n### Gender Roles\n\nGender roles are social and behavioral norms that a given culture considers appropriate for individuals of a specific sex. These roles often determine traditional tasks and responsibilities assigned to women, men, boys, and girls, and are shaped by factors such as household structure, access to resources, the global economy, conflict, disasters, and local ecological conditions.\n\n### Gender Norms\n\nGender norms are the accepted attributes and behaviors associated with male and female identities in a specific society or community at a particular point in time. They establish standards and expectations of how men and women should act. Internalized early in life, gender norms influence lifelong gender socialization and stereotypes.\n\n### Gender Planning\n\nGender planning is an approach that acknowledges the different roles of women and men in society and recognizes that their needs often differ.\n\n### Strategic Gender Needs\n\nThese are the requirements necessary for women and men to improve their status or position in society. Addressing strategic gender needs enables individuals to move beyond restrictive social roles. For women, these needs may include land rights, decision-making power, equal pay, and access to credit.\n\n### Gender Relations\n\nGender relations are a specific subset of social relations that define interactions between men and women as social groups. These relations intersect with other social influences—such as age, ethnicity, race, and religion—to shape individuals’ status and identity. As social constructs, gender relations can be changed.\n\n### Gender Balance\n\nGender balance refers to equal participation of women and men in all areas of work and within programs initiated or supported by institutions. Achieving gender balance creates a more inclusive environment, enhances policy and program effectiveness, and strengthens institutional capacity to serve the entire population.\n\n### Gender Accommodating\n\nIt’s the awareness of gender differences and the willingness to adjust and adapt policies, programs, or actions accordingly. It is closely related to gender sensitivity.\n\n### Gender Perspective\n\nTaking a gender perspective involves considering gender-based differences in any social phenomenon, policy, or process. It emphasizes differences in status and power and examines how gender-based discrimination shapes both immediate needs and long-term interests. In policymaking, a gender perspective ensures that women’s and men’s experiences are equally considered in the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of programs and policies.\n\n### Gender Mainstreaming\n\nGender mainstreaming is the systematic integration of a gender perspective into the preparation, design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of policies, regulations, and spending programs, with the aim of promoting gender equality and eliminating discrimination.\n\n### Gender Mainstreaming in Statistics\n\nThis involves the systematic consideration of gender issues and the elimination of gender-based bias throughout all stages of statistical production.\n\n### Female Genital Mutilation (FGM)\n\nAll procedures involving the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons.\n\n### Domestic Violence\n\nAll acts of physical, sexual, psychological, or economic violence occurring within the family or domestic setting. This applies regardless of biological or legal ties and includes violence between current or former spouses or partners, whether or not they share a residence.\n\n### Gender-Based Violence (GBV)\n\nAn umbrella term for any harmful act perpetrated against a person based on socially ascribed gender differences. GBV varies across cultures and regions and includes sexual violence, domestic violence, trafficking, forced or early marriage, harmful traditional practices (e.g., FGM, honor killings, widow inheritance), and more. These acts may occur in both public and private settings.\n\n### Women’s Issues\n\nThese refer to the unique opportunities, challenges, and constraints that affect women and girls. Due to inadequate representation at decision-making levels, their needs are often overlooked or inadequately addressed.\n\n### Women in Development (WID)\n\nThe WID approach highlights the marginalization of women in development processes. It advocates for the inclusion of women in development initiatives to ensure that they benefit equally from resources and interventions.\n\n### Empowerment\n\nRefers to enhancing the personal, political, social, or economic strength of individuals and communities. Women's empowerment enables them to gain control over their lives through increased awareness, confidence, choice, access to resources, and transformation of discriminatory structures and institutions.\n\n### Women’s Economic Empowerment\n\nRefers to enabling women to participate equally in and benefit from decent work, social protection, market access, and control over resources, time, and decision-making. It also involves increasing women's voice, agency, and participation in economic decisions at all levels, from the household to international institutions.\n\n## Special Population Groups\n\n### Person with Disability\n\nA person with a disability is someone who has a long-term physical, psychological, intellectual, or sensory impairment which, in interaction with various barriers, may hinder their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.\n\n### Disability Cash Benefits\n\nDisability cash benefits refer to financial payments made to individuals who are fully or partially unable to engage in gainful employment due to a disability. The disability may be congenital or acquired as a result of an accident or illness during the individual’s lifetime. These benefits do not include those resulting from prescribed industrial accidents or occupational diseases, which are classified under occupational injury and disease. The provision of goods and services in kind is categorized under services for the elderly and persons with disabilities.\n\n### Stateless Persons\n\nStateless persons are individuals who are not recognized as nationals by any state under the operation of its laws; either because they never acquired a nationality or because they lost it without obtaining a new one.\n\n### Stateless Population, *In Situ*\n\nThis refers to stateless individuals who have never crossed an international border but remain in their “own country”- a place where they have long-standing and significant ties, usually through birth or long-term residence. Their statelessness is often the result of shortcomings in the design or implementation of nationality laws.\n\n### Indigenous Peoples\n\nIndigenous peoples are communities, groups, or individuals who are descended from the original inhabitants of a country or region, and who retain distinct social, cultural, economic, and political characteristics. They often maintain their own languages, traditions, customs, and institutions and have a strong connection to ancestral lands and natural resources. Indigenous peoples typically identify themselves as such and are recognized by others as belonging to distinct cultural groups. Despite their diversity, they frequently face challenges related to marginalization, land rights, and preservation of cultural heritage.\n\n### Guardian\n\nA guardian is an independent adult who safeguards a child’s best interests and general well-being and complements the child’s limited legal capacity.\n\n### Unaccompanied Child\n\nAn unaccompanied child is one who has been separated from both parents and other relatives and is not being cared for by an adult who, by law or custom, is responsible for doing so.\n\n### Alternative Care (Child Protection)\n\nAlternative care refers to arrangements made for children who are temporarily or permanently deprived of their family environment or whose best interests require placement outside their family.\n\n### Best Interests of the Child Principle\n\nAs stated in Article 3 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC): “In all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.”\n\n### Justice for Children\n\nJustice for children refers to a United Nations framework and set of guiding principles aimed at ensuring that justice systems better serve and protect children. It promotes full adherence to international norms and standards for all children who come into contact with justice or related systems, whether as victims, witnesses, alleged offenders, or for matters involving care, custody, or protection.\n\n### Juvenile Justice\n\nJuvenile justice is a justice system designed specifically for children or young persons who are considered juveniles under the respective legal system. It ensures that offenses committed by juveniles are addressed in a manner distinct from how adult offenses are treated. Age limits defining juveniles vary by country.\n\n### Older Person\n\nAccording to the United Nations, an older person is someone aged 60 years or older. However, in many communities, age is also determined by socio-cultural markers such as family status (e.g., being a grandparent), physical appearance (e.g., grey hair, wrinkles), or age-related health conditions.\n\n### Youth\n\nThere is no universally agreed international definition of “youth.” For statistical purposes, however, the United Nations defines youth as individuals between the ages of 15 and 24 years, without prejudice to definitions adopted by individual Member States.\n\n### Person of Concern\n\nThis term traditionally refers to all individuals for whom the UNHCR is mandated to provide protection, assistance, and durable solutions. It includes refugees, asylum-seekers, refugee returnees, stateless persons, and—in many situations—internally displaced persons (IDPs), including those supported by State and non-State partners.\n\n## Living Conditions and Poverty\n\nLiving conditions are the circumstances or factors affecting the way in which people live, particularly with regard to their well-being. The term 'living conditions' is closely related to that of 'quality of life.\n\nPoverty is a state or condition in which an individual lacks the financial resources and essentials for a basic standard of living.\n\n### Welfare Analysis\n\nWelfare analysis, in economics, is the study of how policies or market changes affect the well-being of individuals and society, primarily by measuring the net benefits to consumers and producers.\n\n### Poverty\n\nPoverty is a condition characterized by severe deprivation of basic human needs, such as food, clean water, shelter, education, and healthcare (monetary and non-monetary). It typically results from a lack of access to resources or opportunities to improve one's economic situation. Poverty is often measured by income levels, with individuals or households falling below a certain income threshold considered to be in poverty. However, poverty also encompasses other dimensions, including social exclusion, lack of access to essential services, and limited opportunities for economic and social advancement.\n\n### Household Expenditure\n\nHousehold expenditure refers to the total spending by a person living alone or a group of people living together on goods and services within a specific time period.\n\n### Household Consumption\n\nHousehold consumption is the quantity of goods and services that the household enjoys in a given period.\n\n### Household Consumption Expenditure\n\nHousehold consumption expenditure includes those money outlays directed toward consumption (e.g., it excludes outlays for investment purposes).\n\n### Data Used in Analysis\n\nData used in analysis refers to the specific information, collected and prepared, that is subjected to various techniques and methods to extract meaningful insights, support decision-making, and draw conclusions. It encompasses raw data that has been organized, cleaned, and potentially transformed to make it suitable for analysis.\n\n### Recall Period\n\nThe recall period in an interview refers to the specific timeframe that respondents are asked to remember or reflect upon when providing information. It is a key aspect in survey design, especially in interviews related to data collection on behaviors, expenditures, or experiences.\n\nIn an interview about household income, the recall period might be \"the last month\" or \"the past year,\" and respondents would be asked to report their income or expenditures during that specific period. The choice of recall period is important because it affects the accuracy and reliability of the responses. If the recall period is too long, respondents may forget details or provide inaccurate information. If it is too short, the information might not capture enough relevant data to make meaningful conclusions.\n\n### -Day Recall Period\n\nRecall interviews with a 7-day recall period are used for the collection of food consumption data, as this method provides a good balance between accuracy and cost-effectiveness.\n\n### 1-Month Recall Period\n\nRecall interviews with a 1-month recall period are used for the collection of frequent non-food consumption data.\n\n### 6-Month Recall Period\n\nRecall interviews with a 6-month recall period are used for the collection of less frequent non-food consumption data.\n\n### 1-Year Recall Period\n\nRecall interviews with a 1-year recall period are used for the collection of durable goods consumption data.\n\n### Nominal Consumption Aggregate (NCA)\n\nThe computation of a consumption-based welfare measure consists of assembling the so-called nominal consumption aggregate (NCA) from survey data. NCA is defined as the value of all goods and services consumed by members of the household during the reference period (see Household Consumption Expenditure).\n\n### Modes of Acquisition\n\nAll surveys should collect data on all main modes of food acquisition, namely:\\\n a) Purchases;\\\n b) Household’s own production; and\\\n c) Received in kind/gifts, etc.\n\n### Household’s Own Production\n\nFood from own production includes products usually sold as part of a household’s main commercial enterprise that are instead reserved for consumption (farm households are a typical example), as well as non-commercial and subsistence food production, and food acquired from hunting, fishing, and gathering.\n\n### Food Received in Kind\n\nFood received in kind in the form of transfers from other households, the private sector, or the government.\n\n### Food Away from Home\n\n“Food away from home” generally refers to food prepared away from home, regardless of whether the food is consumed outside or inside the home. This includes meals and snacks purchased from restaurants and other commercial establishments (including takeout meals), received in-kind at school, at work, from other households, etc.\n\n### Non-Food Non-Durable Items\n\nThe non-food non-durable items of the non-food component of the NCA will include all the items in Division 03 “Clothing and Footwear” through to Category 13 “Personal Care, Social Protection, and Miscellaneous Goods,” referencing the Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose (COICOP), the international reference classification of household expenditures (United Nations, 2018).\n\n### Durable Goods (Items)\n\nThe durable goods/items of the non-food component of the NCA include those defined by their durability—meaning their ability to deliver useful services through repeated use over an extended period. Examples include automobiles, household appliances, and electronic devices.\n\n### Hedonic Rent Imputation – Housing Component of the NCA\n\nHedonic rent imputation is a method used in economic analysis to estimate the value of housing or real estate, accounting for attributes that influence price, such as location, size, amenities, and condition. The “hedonic pricing model” assumes the price of a good (in this case, housing) is determined by the sum of the values of its individual characteristics.\n\n### Adjusting for Price Variation\n\nAdjusting for price variation refers to accounting for differences in prices over time or across locations when comparing economic data, such as income, expenditure, or living standards. This adjustment—using either Paasche or Laspeyres price deflators—eliminates the influence of price changes or regional disparities to enable like-for-like comparisons.\n\n### Adjusting for Household Size and Composition\n\nThis refers to modifying economic indicators (such as income or expenditure) to account for differences in the number and characteristics of household members (e.g., age, gender) using equivalence scales or consumption needs.\n\n### Poverty Profile\n\nA description of how the extent of poverty varies across sub-groups of a given population, characterized by gender, geographical location, type of economic activity, income source, etc.\n\n### Poverty Line\n\nThe poverty line is a monetary threshold determined at a specific time and location, representing the minimum level of income or consumption expenditure required to meet basic needs, including food, housing, clothing, and healthcare.\n\n### The Food Poverty Line\n\nThe food poverty line represents the minimum monetary threshold in Kenyan Shillings required to meet nutritional needs based on consumption patterns. It is calculated based on food that provides 2,250 Kcal per adult equivalent per day, over a 30-day period.\n\n### Absolute Poverty/Overall Poverty Line\n\nThe monetary threshold in Kenyan Shillings required to purchase a combination of food and non-food items per adult equivalent per month.\n\n### Food Poverty\n\nIndividuals (or households, if estimated at the household level) whose food consumption per adult equivalent falls below the food poverty line in rural or urban areas are considered food poor or in \"food poverty.\"\n\n### Overall (Absolute) Poverty\n\nIndividuals (or households) whose total (food and non-food) consumption per adult equivalent falls below the overall poverty line are considered in \"overall poverty.\"\n\n### Hardcore (Extreme) Poverty\n\nIndividuals (or households) whose total consumption per adult equivalent is below the food poverty line are considered in \"hardcore poverty.\"\n\n### The Headcount Ratio (HCR or P~0~)/Headcount Ratio (H)\n\nThe proportion of individuals (or households) whose total consumption falls below the poverty line. It is the most commonly used measure of poverty due to its simplicity and ease of interpretation.\n\n### Poverty Gap (P~1~)\n\nThe poverty gap index measures the average shortfall from the poverty line as a percentage. It reflects the mean distance of the poor from the poverty line, with those above the line considered to have zero shortfall. It also indicates the minimum cost to eliminate poverty under perfect targeting.\n\n### Squared Poverty Gap/Severity of Poverty\n\nThis index squares each poverty gap before averaging, placing greater weight on the poorest. It accounts for inequality among the poor.

In other words, climate change includes major changes in temperature, precipitation, or wind patterns, among others, that occur over several decades or longer. It is attributed directly or indirectly to human (anthropogenic) activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere. The term is frequently used in reference to global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions from human activities.\n\n### Climate\n\nRefers to the condition of the atmosphere at a particular location (microclimate) or region over a long period of time. It is the long-term summation of atmospheric elements – such as solar radiation, temperature, humidity, precipitation type (frequency and amount), atmospheric pressure, and wind (speed and direction) – and their variations.\n\n### Weather\n\nWeather is the state of the atmosphere of a given place at a given time. The elements of weather include, but are not limited to, rainfall, temperature, pressure, wind, cloud cover, and humidity.\n\n### Environment\n\nThe totality of all the external conditions (physical, biological, and socio-economic) affecting the life, development, and survival of an organism.\n\n### Climate Model\n\nA numerical representation of the climate system based on the physical, chemical, and biological properties of its components, their interactions, and feedback processes, and accounting for some of its known properties. The climate system can be represented by models of varying complexity; that is, for any one component or combination of components, a spectrum or hierarchy of models can be identified, differing in such aspects as the number of spatial dimensions, the extent to which physical, chemical, or biological processes are explicitly represented, or the level at which empirical parametrizations are involved.\n\n### Climate Prediction\n\nA probabilistic statement about future climate conditions on timescales ranging from seasons to decades. It is based on conditions known at present and assumptions about the physical processes that will determine future changes.

Births do not include creation of entries into the population due to mergers, break-ups, split-off or restructuring of a set of enterprises. It does not include entries into a sub-population resulting only from a change of activity. A birth means the enterprise starts from scratch and actually starts activity. An enterprise creation can be considered as an enterprise birth if new production factors, in particular new jobs, are created. If a dormant unit is reactivated within two years, this event is not considered a birth.\n\n####  Registers of population\n\nAn individualized data system, that is, a mechanism of continuous recording, and/or of coordinated linkage, of selected information pertaining to each member of the resident population of a country in such a way to provide the possibility of determining up-to-date information concerning the size and characteristics of that population at selected time intervals.\n\n#### Registers of dwellings and buildings\n\nReferred to in some countries as real estate registers are registers usually held by land and property valuation agencies, land survey authorities or by local or municipal authorities responsible for the development of housing policies and urban planning.
