The categories are defined in terms of one or more characteristics of a particular population of units of observation. A statistical classification may have a flat, linear structure or may be hierarchically structured, such that all categories at lower levels are sub-categories of a category at the next level up. The categories at each level of the classification structure must be mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive of all objects in the population of interest.\n\n### Broad Economic Category (BEC)\n\n A classification, which groups commodities according to their main end use.\n\n### Central Product Classification (CPC)\n\nA classification based on the physical characteristics of goods or on the nature of the services rendered.

Births do not include creation of entries into the population due to mergers, break-ups, split-off or restructuring of a set of enterprises. It does not include entries into a sub-population resulting only from a change of activity. A birth means the enterprise starts from scratch and actually starts activity.

The principal objective of stratification is to reduce sampling errors.\n\n#### Explicitstratification\n\nThe actual process of dividing the sampling units into specified strata.\n\n#### Implicit stratification\n\nStratifying of a sample frame through geographic sorting , coupled with systematic sampling to achieve the effect of stratification.\n\n#### Intra‑class correlation\n\nA statistical measure used in cluster sampling to show how strongly units within the same cluster resemble each other.\n\n#### Master sample\n\nA large sample drawn from a census frame and prepared for use in a number of surveys, from which sub-samples can be selected for specific surveys.\n\n#### Measure of size (MOS)\n\nThe measure of size is an auxiliary variable, such as the number of households or population of an area, used to assign probabilities of selection for sampling units. For example, the number of households in an EA.\n\n#### Probability Sampling\n\nSample selection method in which the units are selected randomly with known and nonzero probabilities. This is the only way to obtain unbiased estimates and to be able to measure the precision of the survey indicators by estimating the sampling errors.\n\n#### Non‑probability sampling\n\nSampling method in which the units are selected subjectively (non-random). Examples of non-probability sampling methods include: quota, judgmental, purposive, convenience, random walk sampling.\n\n#### Non‑sampling error\n\nErrors in estimates which arise from sources other than sampling variation. Examples include coverage errors, response errors, non-response errors, and processing errors.\n\n#### Content errors\n\nTheseare errors in the characteristics of persons counted, resulting from incorrect reporting or recording or from failure to report.\n\n#### Coverage errors\n\nThese are non-sampling errors that result from omitting a unit that should have been included, including a unit more than once, or including a unit that should not have been included.\n\n#### Sampled population (or survey population)\n\nThe population that is actually covered by the sampling frame is called the survey population or sampled population.\n\n#### Sample\n\nSubset of units, selected from a frame for the purpose of collecting information from those units. The inference about the population as a whole is drawn from the findings based on that sample.\n\n#### Sampling unit\n\nThe unit of selection at each stage of the sampling process, each unit being regarded as individual and indivisible when the selection is made.\n\n#### Primary sampling unit (PSU)\n\nThe sampling unit for the first stage of selection in a multi-stage sampling procedure, typically a geographically defined unit such as an enumeration area (EA) or a segment of an EA.\n\n#### Secondary sampling unit (SSU)\n\nA unit selected in the second stage of a multi-stage sampling process.

In the first phase, a large sample is selected to obtain preliminary information, and in the second phase, a subsample of the initial sample is selected for more detailed information.\n\n#### Design weight\n\nThe basic weight assigned to each unit in the sample, equal to the inverse of its probability of selection according to the survey design.\n\n#### Sampling weight\n\nThe sampling weight (or survey weight) of a sampling unit is the design weight corrected for non-response or other calibrations like poststratification.\n\n#### Poststratification\n\nA statistical adjustment method applied to survey weights after data collection to align the survey estimates with known population totals for certain key variables (like age, sex, or region).\n\n#### Self-weighting sample\n\nA sample is self-weighting if every sampling unit has the same selection probability and hence the same sampling weight.\n\n#### Sampling variance\n\nThe sampling variance of an estimate is the variance of the estimator over all possible samples that could be selected using the same sampling design.\n\n#### Sampling with probability proportionate to size (PPS)\n\nA sampling procedure in which the probability of selecting a sampling unit (such as an enumeration area, cluster, or establishment) is directly proportional to a known measure of its size (e.g., number of households, population, or employees), ensuring that each final element in the population has an equal chance of selection.\n\n#### Self‑weighting Sample design\n\nA sample design in which every unit in the target population has an equal probability of selection, resulting in identical design weights for all sampled units. This ensures that each unit represents the same number of units in the population, simplifying estimation and analysis by removing the need for unequal weighting adjustments.\n\n#### Simple random sample (SRS)\n\nA sample in which each unit of the population has the same probability of inclusion and each possible sample of a given size has the same probability of being selected.\n\n#### Stratified sampling\n\nA probability sampling method in which the population is divided into distinct subgroups, or strata, that are internally homogeneous with respect to certain characteristics but differ across strata. Independent samples are then drawn from each stratum according to specified allocation rules. This approach improves the precision of survey estimates and ensures adequate representation of key subpopulations.\n\n#### Segmentation\n\nA procedure used in multi-stage sampling designs where a selected primary sampling unit (such as an enumeration area or village) is subdivided into smaller, approximately equal parts called segments. One or more segments are then randomly selected for listing. Segmentation ensures manageable fieldwork and maintains equal selection probabilities within large sampling units.\n\n#### Systematic sampling\n\nA probability sampling method in which units are selected at regular intervals from an ordered sampling frame after the random selection of a starting point within the first interval.\n\n#### Target population\n\nThe entire group of units about which survey information is required and to which the survey estimates are intended to apply. The target population should be clearly defined in terms of time, geography, and population characteristics to guide sampling design and ensure relevant, representative results.\n\n#### Unit non-response\n\nThe situation in which a selected unit in the sample, such as a household, individual, or establishment, does not provide any usable information for the survey.
