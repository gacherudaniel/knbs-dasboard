The Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) is pleased to present the Kenya Statistical Quality Assurance Framework (KeSQAF), a comprehensive framework designed to ensure the production of high-quality official statistics that meet international standards and serve the diverse needs of our users.

In today's rapidly evolving data landscape, the demand for timely, accurate, and reliable statistical information has never been greater. Statistics play a crucial role in informing policy decisions, monitoring progress towards development goals, and supporting evidence-based decision-making across all sectors of the economy and society. The emergence of new data sources, technological advancements, and changing user expectations have created both opportunities and challenges for official statistics producers.

The KeSQAF has been developed in response to these evolving needs and changing circumstances. It provides a systematic approach to quality management that encompasses all aspects of statistical production – from the institutional environment and statistical processes to the outputs delivered to users. This framework is firmly grounded in international best practices and principles, particularly drawing from the United Nations National Quality Assurance Framework (UN-NQAF) and other globally recognized quality standards.

The development of KeSQAF represents a significant milestone in our journey towards establishing Kenya as a leader in statistical excellence within the African continent and globally. This framework will guide KNBS and all members of the National Statistical System (NSS) in maintaining the highest standards of professional integrity, methodological soundness, and service delivery.

The framework consists of 19 quality principles organized across four levels:
- **Level A**: Managing the Statistical System
- **Level B**: Managing the Institutional Environment  
- **Level C**: Managing Statistical Processes
- **Level D**: Managing Statistical Outputs

Each principle is supported by detailed requirements and elements to be assured, providing practical guidance for implementation and assessment.

The successful implementation of KeSQAF requires the commitment and active participation of all stakeholders in the statistical ecosystem. I call upon all staff of KNBS, our colleagues in other government agencies, development partners, the private sector, civil society organizations, and the academic community to embrace this framework and work together to strengthen the quality culture in Kenya's statistical system.

I would like to acknowledge the valuable contributions of all who participated in the development of this framework, including the technical experts, development partners, and stakeholders who provided their expertise and insights. Special recognition goes to our development partners who supported this important initiative.

As we embark on the implementation of KeSQAF, we remain committed to continuous improvement and adaptation to meet the evolving needs of our users and the changing statistical landscape. This framework will be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure its continued relevance and effectiveness.

I am confident that KeSQAF will serve as a cornerstone for enhancing the quality, credibility, and utility of official statistics in Kenya, ultimately contributing to evidence-based policy making and sustainable development.
