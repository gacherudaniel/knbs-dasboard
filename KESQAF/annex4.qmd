# Quality Criteria for Validating Citizen Generated Data (CGD) in Kenya {.unnumbered}

## Introduction

Citizen Generated Data (CGD) represents an increasingly important source of information for official statistics. However, ensuring the quality of such data requires systematic validation criteria. This annex presents the framework developed by KNBS for validating CGD for potential use in official statistics.

## Defining the Quality Criteria

The quality criteria for validating CGD are based on the following dimensions:

### 1. Data Credibility
- Source reliability and reputation
- Data collection methodology transparency
- Quality assurance processes implemented by data producers

### 2. Methodological Soundness
- Sampling methodology (if applicable)
- Data collection instruments and procedures
- Coverage of target population

### 3. Accuracy and Precision
- Data validation procedures
- Error detection and correction mechanisms
- Comparison with other data sources

### 4. Timeliness and Frequency
- Currency of data
- Update frequency
- Availability for regular monitoring

### 5. Accessibility and Documentation
- Availability of metadata
- Documentation of limitations
- Access conditions and restrictions

### 6. Comparability
- Alignment with standard classifications
- Consistency over time
- Geographic comparability

## Assigning Scores to the Quality Criteria

Each criterion is evaluated using a scoring system ranging from 1 to 5:

- **Score 5**: Excellent - Fully meets international standards
- **Score 4**: Good - Meets most standards with minor gaps
- **Score 3**: Satisfactory - Meets basic standards
- **Score 2**: Needs Improvement - Significant gaps exist
- **Score 1**: Poor - Major deficiencies, unsuitable for official use

## Minimum Threshold

For CGD to be considered suitable for use in official statistics:

- Overall average score must be ≥ 3.0
- No individual criterion should score below 2.0
- Critical criteria (Data Credibility and Methodological Soundness) must score ≥ 3.0

## Score Allocation Matrix

| Quality Criteria | Weight | Score Range | Threshold |
|------------------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Data Credibility | 25% | 1-5 | ≥3.0 |
| Methodological Soundness | 25% | 1-5 | ≥3.0 |
| Accuracy and Precision | 20% | 1-5 | ≥2.0 |
| Timeliness and Frequency | 15% | 1-5 | ≥2.0 |
| Accessibility and Documentation | 10% | 1-5 | ≥2.0 |
| Comparability | 5% | 1-5 | ≥2.0 |
| **Total** | **100%** | **1-5** | **≥3.0** |

## CGD Scoring Workflow

The following workflow should be followed when evaluating CGD:

1. **Initial Assessment**: Review available documentation and metadata
2. **Detailed Evaluation**: Score each criterion based on established guidelines
3. **Threshold Check**: Verify that minimum thresholds are met
4. **Quality Report**: Document findings and recommendations
5. **Decision**: Approve, approve with conditions, or reject for official use
6. **Monitoring**: Establish ongoing quality monitoring if approved

## Implementation Guidelines

### For CGD Producers
- Provide comprehensive metadata and documentation
- Implement quality assurance procedures
- Maintain transparency in methodology
- Ensure regular updates and maintenance

### For KNBS Evaluators
- Use standardized evaluation forms
- Document all assessment decisions
- Consult with subject matter experts
- Maintain evaluation records for transparency

### For Users
- Understand limitations of CGD
- Use appropriate caveats in publications
- Monitor data quality over time
- Report issues to KNBS quality unit

## Quality Gateway Dimensions

| Dimension | Description | Key Indicators |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Governance** | Data producer accountability and oversight | Organizational structure, policies, procedures |
| **Methodology** | Technical approach to data collection | Sampling, instruments, validation |
| **Quality Management** | Systems for ensuring data quality | Quality controls, error detection, auditing |
| **Transparency** | Openness about methods and limitations | Documentation, metadata, public reporting |
| **Sustainability** | Long-term viability of data source | Funding, capacity, institutional support |

This framework ensures that CGD used in official statistics meets appropriate quality standards while recognizing the unique characteristics and potential value of citizen-generated information.
