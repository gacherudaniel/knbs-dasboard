# Quality Assurance Principles and Requirements

The KeSQAF quality principles and associated requirements consist of four levels, ranging from overarching institutional and cross-institutional management and statistical production processes to the outputs:

**Level A**: Managing the statistical system;

**Level B**: Managing the institutional environment;

**Level C**: Managing statistical processes; and

**Level D**: Managing statistical outputs.

Each level contains a concise set of principles and requirements to guarantee quality in that aspect of quality assurance. These requirements are vital indicators that, when met, will ensure that provisions have been made to assure quality.

A list of elements to be assured, which supports and assists the implementation of the principles and requirements and provides more detail are stated below each requirement. The elements to be assured are good practices and should be followed or assured.

## Level A: Managing the Statistical System

The National Statistical System is the ensemble of the National Statistical Office, the KNBS, and other statistical units in Kenya that produce, provide, supply, use and disseminate official statistics on behalf of the Government of Kenya under the supervision and coordination of the Bureau.

### Principle 13: Managing the Respondent Burden

Individuals, households or businesses that provide the data upon which statistical products are based are fundamental contributors to the quality of data and information. The requirement to collect data should be balanced against production costs and the burden placed on respondents. Mechanisms to maintain good relationships with providers of data and to proactively manage the respondent burden are essential to improving quality. This Principle is supported by principle 5 of the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics on Sources of Official Statistics on prevention of misuse.

**Requirement 13.1:** The range and detail of requested information is limited to what is necessary.

Elements to be assured:
i. The availability and suitability of existing surveys and administrative or other data sources are explicitly considered before suggesting a new survey.

## Level D: Managing Statistical Outputs

Statistics serve the needs of national governments, research institutions, businesses, the general public and the international community. The output quality is measured by the extent to which the statistics are relevant, accurate and reliable, timely and punctual, readily accessible by and clear to users, and coherent and comparable across geographical regions and over time.

### Principle 14: Assuring Relevance

Statistical information should meet the current and/or emerging needs or requirements of its users. Without relevance, there is no quality. However, relevance is subjective and depends upon the varying needs of users. The challenge is to weigh and balance the conflicting needs of current and potential users to produce statistics that satisfy the most important and highest priority needs within the given resource constraints. Principle 14 is supported mainly by principle 1 of the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics on relevance, impartiality, and equal access.
