# African Charter on Statistics Principles {.unnumbered}

The African Charter on Statistics was adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the African Union in February 2009. The Charter provides a continental framework for the development of statistics in Africa.

## Principle 1: Professional Independence
The professional independence of statistical authorities from political and other external interference in developing, producing and disseminating official statistics is a prerequisite for credible official statistics.

## Principle 2: Mandate for Data Collection
For statistical authorities to be able to provide complete and reliable statistics, they must have the mandate to access all data sources and the authority to collect data.

## Principle 3: Adequacy of Resources
The financial, human and technological resources available to statistical authorities should be sufficient to enable them to produce relevant, reliable and timely statistics.

## Principle 4: Quality Commitment
All involved in the production of official statistics should commit to ensuring that the statistics produced meet the highest quality standards and international norms, in particular with respect to professional ethics.

## Principle 5: Statistical Confidentiality
The privacy of data providers (households, individuals, businesses and other respondents), the confidentiality of the information they provide and its use only for statistical purposes must be guaranteed.

## Principle 6: Impartiality
Statistical authorities must produce and disseminate official statistics in an objective, professional and transparent manner in which all users are treated equitably.

## Principle 7: Equal Access
Official statistics constitute public information and should be available to all citizens on an equal basis and at the same time.

## Principle 8: Coordination and Harmonization
Consistent and integrated official statistics are essential. This requires coordination among producers of official statistics within countries and harmonization at regional and continental levels.

## Principle 9: Use of International Standards
Official statistics should be compiled using international concepts, classifications, definitions and methods to ensure consistency and facilitate comparison.

## Principle 10: Regional and Continental Cooperation
Regional and continental cooperation in statistical development is essential for improving official statistics, building statistical capacity and reducing costs.
