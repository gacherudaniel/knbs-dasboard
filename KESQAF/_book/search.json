    "text": "1.1 Introduction\nIn recent years, new data sources, data providers and statistics producers have emerged, fueled by technological advances and new demands for detailed and timely data for policy making to address various development agendas. This new data ecosystem poses challenges and opportunities for official statistics. For instance, in the future, national statistical offices may see their role as a producer of official statistics diminished while adopting a new role as a curator of data and statistics produced by others. There is, therefore, a need for a National Quality Assurance Framework (NQAF) that provides a coherent and holistic system for statistical quality management that guarantees trust in the quality of official statistics. Official statistics need to be produced in an objective, transparent and professionally independent manner, in order to achieve and maintain public trust (UNCTAD, 2019). In light of this, the UN-NQAF manual for Official Statistics was adopted in 2019 to guide countries in the implementation of their respective NQAF (United Nations, 2019). The 19 quality principles and their associated requirements from the United Nations National Quality Assurance Framework (UN NQAF) manual are all borrowed in the development of the Kenya Statistical Quality Assurance Framework (KeSQAF). KeSQAF aims to address quality assurance in different circumstances and situations, thereby supporting the country in safeguarding the role of official statistics as a trusted source of information in a changing environment. This section presents the rationale for developing the quality assurance framework, the benefits of KeSQAF and the policies, strategies and frameworks supporting KeSQAF. Definitions of the adopted quality dimensions are also presented in this section.",

    "section": "1.2 Quality Context",
    "text": "1.2 Quality Context\n\n1.2.1 Rationale for a Quality Assurance Framework\nThe Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) is the National Statistics office in Kenya and is mandated to collect, compile, analyse, publish, and disseminate statistical information for public use. It is the principal agency for official statistics produced in the country. Official statistics are not only indispensable inputs for planning, monitoring and assessing attainment of the targets of the national development agenda, strategic objectives of businesses and research objectives of academicians, but are also useful for other evidence-based decision-making.\nGiven KNBS’s obligation to provide statistics that inform decision-making and the need to provide leadership to members of the NSS and other producers of statistics, there is a need for a framework to support the production of high-quality statistics. The UN NQAF manual recommends the use of the Generic Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM) which provides a roadmap on the various sets of business processes required to produce official statistics. GSBPM outlines steps in the data production process that include, identification of needs, design, data collection and processing, data analysis and reporting, dissemination and documentation and lastly, evaluation. Care has to be taken to guard against errors in the statistical business process and to mitigate and/or correct deficiencies by providing supportive legal, administrative and technological infrastructure and institutional environment. This is the context in which KeSQAF has been developed to manage the quality of the organization’s services, statistical processes and related products, as well as communication with stakeholders in a systematic and formalized way.\nThe quality assurance framework provides transparency and clarity necessary to manage and respond to data users’ expectations, queries and demands while bolstering the credibility of the organization. It is the responsibility of KNBS to clearly articulate the concepts and definitions that form the basis for the statistics produced while outlining the methodologies used. It is also KNBS’s responsibility to check on erroneous interpretation and misuse of statistics. This is especially useful for addressing instances when the reasonableness of statistics published across NSS is questioned by stakeholders whose concerns may be based on the limited understanding of the methodologies used in generating the statistics.\nThe KNBS is part of a global statistical system characterized by increasing interconnectedness, a dynamic knowledge economy and the use of rapidly changing technology that requires openness and adherence to scientific and professional standards, including the use of a common architectural framework that allows for the sharing and exchange of information. The Bureau, therefore, does not operate in isolation but with other producers of statistics locally, regionally and internationally. Information sharing with its partners necessitates adequate provision for access to data, with due regard for confidentiality, coherence and comparability of statistics. Kenya ascribes to global, continental and regional development agendas such as Agenda 2063 on Africa Charter for Development of Statistics and the 2030 Global Development Agenda for Sustainable Development implying that statistics of high quality are necessary for tracking progress in attaining these development goals.\nThe UN Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics (UNFPOS) and Principles Governing International Statistical Activities (PGISA) promote coordination and cooperation among national organizations for official statistics to improve systems of official statistics globally. Against this background, there is a need for modernization of the Bureau’s statistical production and services which is also being driven by the need to reduce the response burden and improve efficiencies in the production of official statistics. Additionally, data users have an increasing demand for more timely and accurate data and there is growing competition from alternative data producers and researchers moving up the statistical value chain. This, therefore, requires that KNBS steps up in the implementation of its mandate to ensure that the statistics produced across NSS are of high quality.\n\n\n1.2.2 Benefits of the Kenya Statistical Quality Assurance Framework\nThe quality assurance framework has a well-defined and responsive structure that provides context for quality concerns, activities and initiatives and explains the relationships between the various quality procedures and tools. The framework provides a single platform to record and reference the full range of current quality concepts, dimensions and practices and is forward-looking since it is flexible to take into account future actions and activities.\nThe quality assurance framework also serves to formalize both operational standards and criteria for evaluating the fitness of statistical data for their required purposes, as well as the methodologies used for data collection, processing, analysis and dissemination, and strategic and managerial issues of statistics.\nIn addition, KeSQAF aims to improve consistency and efficiency in the NSS by reducing duplication of efforts; normalizing the use of international concepts, definitions, classifications, standards, sampling frames, and methodologies, where appropriate; and, creating datasets that are responsive to data sharing demands.\nKeSQAF aims at increasing effectiveness and efficiency in the production of statistics in the Country. The framework also forms a foundation for validating data from both primary and alternative sources.\n\n\n1.2.3 Policies, Strategies and Frameworks Supporting the Development and Implementation of KeSQAF\nThe development and implementation of KeSQAF is supported by various legal frameworks, strategies, policies, procedures and statistical quality frameworks. These include the:\n\nStatistics Act, 2006;\nKenya Strategy for Development of Statistics (KSDS);\nISO 9001:2015 standards;\nExisting Data Quality Assessment Frameworks (DQAFs);\nUnited Nations National Quality Assurance Framework (UN-NQAF);\nUN Principles Governing International Statistical Activities;\nAfrican Charter on Statistics;\nInternational Statistical Institute’s (ISI) Declaration on Professional Ethics;\nStatistical Data and Metadata Exchange (SDMX);\nEuropean Statistics (Eurostat) Code of Practice (CoP).",

    "section": "1.3 Quality Concepts",
    "text": "1.3 Quality Concepts\nQuality is a multidimensional concept, which means the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfils requirements. Quality is in reference to statistical output, the statistical process that produced it, the institutional environment housing the process, or the whole statistical system. The KNBS adopts the “Fit for purpose” approach, whereby statistics produced are appropriate and are of necessary standards for their intended use. This, therefore, means that the users of statistics will be continually engaged so that data produced in the Country is of the highest standard, integrity and credibility and addresses gaps/needs of the users. Data quality is expressed in terms of dimensions. In line with international best practices and recommendations, KNBS has adopted 11 key quality dimensions for assuring statistical quality. These are relevance, accuracy, reliability, timeliness, punctuality, accessibility, clarity/interpretability, coherence, consistency, methodological soundness and integrity. It is important to note that these quality dimensions strongly focus on the quality of the statistical output and are, therefore, a subset of the 19 quality principles adopted in KeSQAF.\n\n1.3.1 Relevance\nis the “degree to which statistical information meets the real or perceived needs of clients.” This dimension of quality addresses how useful official statistics are for the issues that are important to users. Resource constraints necessitate the identification of and responsiveness to the most important needs among many user needs.\n\n\n1.3.2 Accuracy\nrefers to the “closeness of computations or estimates to the unknown exact or true values that the statistics were intended to measure.” This reflects the degree of nearness that official statistics have achieved in correctly representing the phenomena they measure. This can be expressed in terms of quantitative measures of accuracy, including possible sources of error such as coverage, sampling, non-response and response error rates; or qualitative assessment indicators.\n\n\n1.3.3 Reliability\nis closely associated with accuracy and speaks of the “closeness of the initial estimated value to the subsequent estimated value.” Consistently large differences between subsequent estimates to an initial estimate suggest possible bias in the initial estimate, while random large gaps between subsequent estimates and an initial estimate may indicate a need to re-assess the timeliness of subsequent estimates.\n\n\n1.3.4 Timeliness\npertains to the “length of time between data availability and the event or phenomenon they describe.” This references both:\n\nthe time lapse between the end of a reference date/period for data collection and receipt of the data for compilation and processing (timeliness of source data), and\nthe time lapse between the end of a reference date/period and data dissemination (timeliness of output).\n\n\n\n1.3.5 Punctuality\nis closely associated with timeliness and is the “time lag between the actual delivery of the data and the target date when it should have been delivered.” This relates to whether or not data are disseminated on scheduled release dates. Data that is punctual may still be considered untimely if the release date lags too far behind its reference period (i.e., the time of the occurrence of the event/phenomenon), rendering it less useful or useless for decision-making.\n\n\n1.3.6 Accessibility\nrefers to “the ease and conditions under which statistical information can be obtained.” This relates not only to how easily data can be accessed by users but also to the form the data are in and the means through which users have access to the data.\n\n\n1.3.7 Clarity\nis “the extent to which easily comprehensible metadata are available, where these metadata are necessary to give a full understanding of statistical data.” It addresses whether or not statistical data are complemented by descriptive information about the data’s quality and limitations and if additional assistance is available to users by providers to enable users to work with the data to meet their needs.\n\n\n1.3.8 Coherence\nis the “adequacy of statistics to be combined in different ways and for different uses. It refers to comparisons between statistics for the same or largely similar populations.” Coherence in statistics is the degree to which the data constitute a logical picture of the population they are describing. For example, in the domain of labour statistics, the employed and unemployed must account for 100 per cent of the labour force.\n\n\n1.3.9 Consistency\nrefers to statistics having “logical and numerical coherence.”\n\n\n1.3.10 Methodological Soundness\nis “the extent to which the methodology used to compile statistics complies with the relevant international standards, including the professional standards enshrined in the UN Fundamental Principles for Official Statistics.”\n\n\n1.3.11 Integrity\nrefers to “values and related practices that maintain confidence in the eyes of users in the agency producing statistics and ultimately in the statistical product.” It is adherence to ethical and professional standards to ensure that transparency, accountability, methodological soundness, and professional independence guide the policies and practices of producing and disseminating official statistics.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "2.1 Situational Analysis\nAccording to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the National Statistical System (NSS) is the ensemble of statistical organizations and units within a country, that jointly collect, process and disseminate official statistics on behalf of the government. In Kenya, the NSS includes producers, suppliers and users of official statistics working under the supervision and coordination of the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics.\nThe Constitution of Kenya, which was enacted in 2010 changed the administrative structure of the country that brought in a devolved system of governance. The country has a National Government and 47 County Governments. The constitution categorized statistics as a concurrent function between the two levels of Government. Specifically, the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution bestows the responsibility of national statistics and data on population, the economy and society generally on the National Government while County Governments are responsible for statistics for county planning and development. The National Government has the role of national economic policy and planning, capacity building and technical assistance to the counties.\nThe statistical system in Kenya is centralized, in that, KNBS is established by the Statistics Act, 2006 as the producer of official statistics and the only institution in the country to certify statistics produced as official. The Statistics Act provides the legal basis for the NSS and establishes KNBS as the principal agency of government responsible for the collection, compilation, analysis, publication and dissemination of statistical information, and the coordination of the NSS. With respect to coordination of the NSS, the Act mandates KNBS to: collaborate with and assist the county governments or any other institutions in the production of official statistics; provide technical advice on statistics to other state entities; promote coordination among producers, users and suppliers of official statistics by forming appropriate sector committees; designating statistics produced by the NSS as official statistics on being satisfied that the necessary criteria have been followed.\nThe Bureau achieves the NSS coordination role through several mechanisms. The planning of statistical activities and programmes in the NSS is achieved through the development and implementation of a National Strategy for Development of Statistics (NSDS). The NSDS in Kenya is referred to as the Kenya Strategy for Development of Statistics (KSDS). For the development of KSDS, a unit producing statistics is referred to as a statistical sector. These include a data production unit, user unit or both producer and user units that generate and or demand specific statistics. The Strategy is an international best practice and is developed in line with the regional Strategies for the development of statistics and the Strategy for the Harmonization of Statistics in Africa (ShASA). The strategy is developed and implemented through two committees: The Inter- Agency Statistical Committees (IaSC) and the Sector Statistics Committee (SSC). The IaSC comprises of heads of Departments where the Statistical Units are domiciled in the various MDAs. The SSC is made up of nominated staff from the units handling statistics in the statistics sectors. The two committees play a big role in the development, approval and implementation of the sector statistics plans which form the building blocks for the KSDS. The structure and reporting levels for the implementation of KSDS is shown in figure 1.0.\nThe technical capacity building and harmonization of statistics within the NSS is achieved through technical working groups and committees, on different thematic/sectoral areas. The technical committees/groups are made up of statisticians and statistics focal persons from the various MDAs and meet on a quarterly basis to interrogate and harmonize data on the respective sectors/thematic areas. The established technical working groups/committees include Agriculture, Nutrition and Environment; Trade and trade Facilitation and Balance of payment; Gender Statistics; Health Statistics; Education Statistics; Governance Statistics; Tourism Statistics; Monetary Statistics; Disability Statistics; and Energy Statistics. The coordination also extends to the representation of the country in regional, continental and global statistical committees on various thematic areas.\nThe implementation of activities in the NSS cannot be carried out in oblivion of the evolving data ecosystems. The national data ecosystem is the entire network of data collectors, data producers, data analysts and other data users across the data value chain and the associated infrastructure and enablers in Kenya. Coordination in the ecosystem involves the linkages with activities of the non-State actors that produce statistics, the legal infrastructure to support this linkage and extension of the capacity building beyond the production of official statistics to strengthen the capacity of non-state actors to produce statistics that can be utilized for official reporting.\nThe Bureau also organizes and participates in technical workshops that bring together stakeholders in the management of statistics, including the development partners and non- state actors. The focus of all the tools of coordination of the NSS is statistical capacity building and ensuring sustainability in the production and use of quality statistics. Training and capacity need assessments for the NSS are continually undertaken to inform the development of roadmaps for training and offering technical assistance to the NSS members to enhance the quality of statistics produced in the NSS and the wider data ecosystem.\nThe coordination of the NSS ensures: Harmonization of concepts, definitions, classifications, sampling frames, and statistical methods and dissemination policies to make statistical outputs comparable across the NSS as well as in the wider data ecosystem; Effective data collection and proper data sharing of administrative and other data sources; Strengthening of the position of and enhancing the credibility of official statistics; representation of a country in international statistical cooperation and policies; implementation of mechanisms to allow the assessment and guarantee the quality of statistics produced by NSS members; and monitoring and reporting on progress regarding, sub-national, national, regional, continental and global development agendas. In addition, the NSS is expected to evolve to respond to user needs, technological changes as well as institutional changes.\nAn assessment of the environment in which statistical production processes are undertaken is critical in understanding the strategic positioning to inform the determination of short and medium-term strategies concerning statistical quality. Analysis of the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) in the NSS is critical in understanding its immediate operational environment. The analysis has been carried out by assessing the competitive advantages (Strengths), controllable internal disadvantages (Weaknesses), external possibilities for success (Opportunities) and uncontrollable external negative factors (Threats) in the statistical production processes within the NSS.",

    "section": "3.4 Level D: Managing Statistical Outputs",
    "text": "3.4 Level D: Managing Statistical Outputs\nStatistics serve the needs of national governments, research institutions, businesses, the general public and the international community. The output quality is measured by the extent to which the statistics are relevant, accurate and reliable, timely and punctual, readily accessible by and clear to users, and coherent and comparable across geographical regions and over time.\n\n3.4.1 Principle 14: Assuring Relevance\nStatistical information should meet the current and/or emerging needs or requirements of its users. Without relevance, there is no quality. However, relevance is subjective and depends upon the varying needs of users. The challenge is to weigh and balance the conflicting needs of current and potential users to produce statistics that satisfy the most important and highest priority needs within the given resource constraints. Principle 14 is supported mainly by principle 1 of the Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics on relevance, impartiality, and equal access.\nRequirement 14.1: Procedures are in place to identify users and their needs and to consult them about the content of the statistical work programme.\nElements to be assured: i. There is legislation or some other formal provision that includes an obligation to consult with the main users of the statistics. ii. Structured and periodic consultation processes (e.g., advisory councils and committees or working groups) with key stakeholders and users are in place to review the content of the statistical programme and the usefulness of existing statistics, and to identify requirements for new statistics. iii. Feedback from a user support service, centre or hotline is analysed to understand and identify user needs. iv. Data on the use of statistics (e.g., web analytics, number and types of downloads, subscribers to reports) are collected and analysed to improve statistical outputs.\nRequirement 14.2: Users’ needs and requirements are balanced, prioritized and reflected in the work programme.\nElements to be assured: i. Users’ priority needs are met and reflected in the work plan of KNBS and Statistical Units. ii. Procedures are in place to prioritize various user needs in the work plan programme and strategic goals. iii. Data on the use of statistics are analysed to support the setting of priorities. iv. A periodic evaluation of the work plan is carried out to identify emerging needs and lower priorities. v. Processes are in place to monitor and consult with stakeholders on the relevance and practical utility of existing statistics (with regard to scope, level of detail, cost, etc.) according to current and emerging user needs.\nRequirement 14.3: Statistics based on new and existing data sources are being developed in response to society’s emerging information needs.\nElements to be assured: i. A mechanism such as Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs) are established to consider and experiment with new data sources to meet emerging information needs. ii. Cooperation with the scientific community and owners or holders of new data sources is established to experiment with and pioneer the use of these data sources. iii. Possibilities of exploiting new data sources are regularly discussed by management.\nRequirement 14.4: User satisfaction is regularly measured and systematically followed up.\nElements to be assured: i. User satisfaction surveys and user studies are regularly carried out and analyzed. ii.

Systems for assessing and validating source data, integrated data, intermediate results and statistical outputs are developed and managed. ii. Data are systematically checked and compared with data from other sources and over time. iii. Results of statistics are compared with other existing information in order to ensure validity.\nRequirement 15.2: Sampling errors are measured, evaluated and documented. Non-sampling errors are described and, when possible, estimated.\nElements to be assured: i. Procedures and guidelines are available on how to measure and manage (e.g., reduce or balance) errors. ii. Sources of possible sampling errors are identified and described. iii. Sampling errors are measured and evaluated. iv. Non-sampling errors are identified, described and evaluated. v. Errors are analysed to identify improvement measures. vi. Information about the sampling and non-sampling errors is made available to users as part of the metadata.\nRequirement 15.3: Studies and analyses of revisions are carried out and used to improve data sources, statistical processes and outputs.\nElements to be assured: i.

Staff training and development programmes are in place with regard to writing about statistics (for press releases, publication highlights or other explanatory texts). v. Up-to-date methodological documents (on concepts, scope, classifications, the basis of recording, data sources, compilation methods and statistical techniques), as well as quality reports and the work programme of KNBS’s and Statistical Units, are made available to the public. vi. Explanatory texts accompanying the statistics are reviewed for clarity and readability. vii. Meaningful comparisons are included in the publications when appropriate. viii. Preliminary and revised data are identified and explained in published statistics. ix. Metadata needed to understand and use the statistics are published together with the statistics. x. A policy for archiving published statistics is in place.\nRequirement 17.2: A data dissemination strategy and policy exists and is made public.\nElements to be assured: i. The public is made aware that custom-designed outputs, statistics not routinely disseminated and longer time series can be provided on request when feasible, and it is instructed on how the data can be ordered. These outputs are made public if possible. ii. Catalogues of publications and other services are made available to users. iii. While official statistics are normally free and accessible for everyone, statistics that need to be produced on request might have a cost corresponding to the extra work they require. The pricing of special requests is fully transparent. iv. A strategy has been developed and agreed upon with stakeholders for the release of anonymized data and microdata.\nRequirement 17.3: Modern information and communication technology is used for facilitating easy access to statistics.\nElements to be assured: i.

    "section": "",
    "text": "4.1 Institutional Arrangements\nThe KNBS is responsible for spearheading the development of the national quality assurance framework in consultation with the stakeholders in the national data ecosystem. It will also ensure that the framework is adopted and that the national legislation and provision support its implementation across the national data ecosystem. This will guide the production of statistics as well as outline the criteria for monitoring and assessing the quality of statistics produced in the country. It will be an assurance that the players in the data ecosystem commit to continually assess and improve the statistics produced in the Country.\nThe specific institutional arrangements and roles of the quality units, task forces, quality managers, quality champions and focal points, and quality networks, among other things, that are involved in quality assurance are expected to evolve over time. Quality management therefore must be institutionalized. The following institutional arrangements for the implementation of KeSQAF will be set up.\nA quality unit will be maintained at KNBS for quality management and coordination within KNBS in order to maintain sufficient capacity to lead and support the implementation of quality management initiatives throughout KNBS, and to support other NSS members and producers of official statistics if required. Other major statistics producers within the NSS will be encouraged to establish their own internal quality units to support the work on quality within their organizations. As per the current organizational structure, the quality unit in KNBS is the Methods and Standards Section. The head of the section will be the Quality Manager for KeSQAF.\nAn internal quality task force consisting of representatives of the quality unit and representatives from each of the other directorates of KNBS to serve as quality champions/focal points in their respective functional areas will be maintained. There is already an established Quality Working Group (QWG) at KNBS. The QWG will support KeSQAF implementation throughout KNBS. The QWG will serve as a forum in which quality related issues in the various aspects of KNBS operations can be addressed at both the strategic management and the operational level. The QWG will also serve as a mobilization mechanism for quality management initiatives, such as documentation workshops or specialized training workshops for improving quality, among other things. Other major producers of official statistics will be encouraged to establish their own internal task forces.\nIn order to mainstream quality at functional areas, KNBS Heads of Divisions will be designated as Quality Assurance Managers and will be responsible for establishing the quality assurance plan, defining all the quality activities and quality indicators to be implemented and computed in their divisions.\nThe National Quality Working Group (NQWG) will be an NSS-wide quality working group that provides overall support to the implementation and monitoring of the KeSQAF. Members of the NSS will be supported by the NQWG to establish their internal quality units to support the work of quality assurance within their organizations in the implementation of KeSQAF. The IaSC will ensure that each of the producers and suppliers in the NSS own and adhere to the standards and practices provided for in the KeSQAF. Within the NQWG will be the Technical Working Group on alternative sources of data which will ensure the criteria for ensuring quality are adhered to in the production of statistics by Non-State Actors (NSAs) and monitor the use of the Criteria for validating CGD. The NQWG will be responsible for determining the structure and level of detail of the KeSQAF and its revision; sensitization of the data ecosystem players on the KeSQAF; developing tools for assessment of quality and conducting quality assessments of data produced in the country; developing capacity building programmes and implementing them in the country; Setting up focus groups regarding several key challenges that most of the data producers will face, such as quality assurance of administrative data sources, policies regarding the incorporation of new data sources and data made available by new data providers from outside the NSS and the standardization of metadata, among other things; Guiding proposals for the amendment of legal acts and administrative regulations to include quality assurance; Cooperating with the national task force on the SDG indicators in developing an action plan on quality assurance; Proposing coordinated policies on quality assurance with regard to the use of data supplied by providers; Developing guidelines on the structure of the quality reports to be prepared by data producers and agreeing on a schedule for their submission; Coordinating user outreach, including user-producer dialogues. KNBS will provide a secretariat for the working groups.",

    "section": "4.5 Assessment and Reporting",
    "text": "4.5 Assessment and Reporting\nAs part of quality management, statistical quality assessment is integral to the overall quality management system in statistics production. This will be conducted on the statistical products and processes but will also be extended to the statistical system and institutional environment. The methods adopted for statistical quality assessment will include quality indicators, quality reports, user surveys, external and self-assessments and auditing (internal or external quality reviews), peer reviews and labelling.\nIn line with international best practice, the overarching relationship between KeSQAF, GSBPM and GAMSO will be used for quality assessment for Levels A, B, C and D as well as guiding the development of additional assessment tools. The use of GSBPM will allow the evaluation of the statistical production process and its sub-processes which will help in the detection of errors and taking of appropriate actions to mitigate the risk of undesirable impacts on statistical products.\nThis will specifically assess:\n\nproduct quality in terms of the five quality principles: relevance; accuracy and reliability; timeliness and punctuality; accessibility and clarity; and coherence and comparability.\nprocess quality in terms of four quality principles: methodological soundness; cost-effectiveness; appropriate statistical procedures; and managing respondent burden; and\nquality of the NSS and the institutional environment in terms of nine quality principles: coordination; relationships with stakeholders; statistical standards; professional independence; impartiality and objectivity; transparency; statistical confidentiality and data security; commitment to quality; and adequacy of resources.\n\nThe KNBS through the QWG will develop quality indicators for the assessment framework guided by the international best practices. In acknowledging the collaborative approach needed to adequately define and develop quality indicators, data producers and users will be continuously engaged in the creation and revision of a quality assessment framework document.\nIn general, the use of quality indicators, the production of quality reports and the conduct of user surveys are considered the basic level of quality assessment tools. Self-assessment and audits constitute the next level of quality assessment, while labeling can be looked upon as an advanced process.\n\n4.5.1 Quality Indicators\nThe KNBS through the QWG will define and develop quality indicators to measure compliance with the respective quality principles and requirements. During the development of quality indicators, those linked to GSBPM will be reviewed and used where applicable. Input from users will also be considered.\n\n\n4.5.2 Quality Reports\nQuality reports describe the outcome of quality assessments according to quality indicators. These reports will convey necessary information to enable users to assess the quality of the product. Quality reports can also be an important monitoring tool for statistics producers and managers. The quality assessment framework will outline a standard reporting structure that allows for comparability of statistical programmes based on predetermined specific quality indicators.\n\n\n4.5.3 Obtaining Feedback from Users\nKNBS has adopted the best practice of regularly consulting its data users about their needs and perceptions of data quality, through a user satisfaction survey. User feedback will be a distinct component of the quality assessment framework and KNBS commits to conducting follow up with data users through appropriate mediums. This will also form a basis for continuous improvement from user feedback.\n\n\n4.5.4 Conducting Assessments\nRegular predetermined self and external assessments; internal and external quality audits and peer reviews will be the main tools used to conduct assessments. The QWG will develop self-assessment checklists to be used for systematic assessment of the quality of the statistical production process. Self-assessment will be conducted by members within their functional areas at both KNBS and NSS supported by the NQWG. Regardless of the assessment context, results will be used to assess the degree of compliance for each of the requirements and describe strengths and weaknesses to enhance quality in the statistics produced within and outside NSS; by extension, it will demonstrate transparency about the extent to which data quality standards are met.\n\n\n4.5.5 Labeling\nThe next level will involve comparing assessment results with defined standards and requirements. Labelling shows the extent to which a set of quality standards are met. The attachment of a label requires a procedure to guarantee that the message is appropriate and true. This is for designating statistics as official or assessing their adequacy in terms of quality reporting. Thereafter, predetermined labels will accompany the various levels of fulfilment of quality standards with corresponding explanatory notes for each label. The methods and procedures for labelling will be developed by KNBS.",

    "text": "4.6 Quality Assurance for Statistics Compiled from Different Data Sources\nThree types of statistics producers at the national level can be distinguished: KNBS, other producers of official statistics and other statistics producers outside of the NSS. Data providers are entities that own or hold the data used in the production of statistics (source data). All types of statistics producers can use any type or combination of data sources, be they statistical, administrative, or other data sources.\nFor the purposes of this KeSQAF, it is suggested that data sources be distinguished by their purpose and by the entity responsible for data compilation. While it is acknowledged that others may want to define and distinguish data sources differently according to their respective needs, the following definitions and classification of data sources are proposed for the purposes of this KeSQAF:\n\nStatistical data sources are data collections created primarily for official statistical purposes by government agencies or other entities working on behalf of the government. Statistical data sources include statistical sample surveys, censuses and statistical registers. There are different types of censuses, such as population and housing censuses, business censuses and agriculture censuses, among other types. Sample surveys and statistical registers can cover different units, for example, individuals, households and businesses. Statistical registers can themselves be derived from different sources. For example, statistical business registers are often based on administrative data sources;\nAdministrative data sources are data sets created primarily for administrative purposes by government agencies or other entities working on behalf of the government. Administrative data sources include administrative registers of persons and legal entities and the records of ministries, departments and specialized agencies, such as tax returns, social services records and customs data, or data of regional or local administrations. In contrast to statistical data sources, administrative data sources are not created in response to the need for statistical data but as a part of a government function, such as the provision of services or taxation. In some cases, statistical agencies participate in the design and/or collection of administrative data. In addition, statistical agencies may be involved at different stages of the production process of administrative data, to ensure that the data will be usable for statistical purposes;\nOther data sources include all data sets that are not created primarily for official statistical or administrative purposes but rather for commercial or other private purposes. Examples of other data sources include:\n\nCross-country sample surveys by supranational organizations or international enterprises;\nData compiled and maintained by private professional organizations or business associations, or by non-profit institutions in general;\nData and records compiled and maintained and/or owned by enterprises that cover large parts of the population of statistical units, in particular e-commerce, media and telecommunications providers, but also other enterprises that provide services directly to individuals or businesses, such as insurance companies, banks and airlines;\nEarth observation and remote sensing;\nThematic mapping and monitoring systems (e.g., field-monitoring stations for water quality, air pollution, etc.);\nResearch/scientific and pilot studies and\nCitizen-generated data.\n\n\nInterest in the use of other data sources (including the data sources covered by the term “big data”) for the compilation of official statistics has been growing over the years. With the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and given the global and national data required to measure progress towards the SDGs, the use of other “new” data sources was identified as one of the top priorities for NSSs. Considering both the benefits and concerns/limitations of the use of the new data sources in official statistics, the United Nations Statistical Commission promoted their use and, at the same time, emphasized “the importance of ensuring the quality of data derived from new sources and new data providers, including those outside the official statistical system”.\nThe Bureau will develop guidelines and criteria for assessing “other data sources” for use in reporting for national or sub-national indicators.",

    "text": "4.7 Continuous Improvement of KeSQAF\nSince the global statistical community is progressive, there is a need to assure continuous quality improvements. Ongoing developments in quality management require responsiveness that can assure current and ongoing improvement in the quality assured. As such, monitoring of new information on quality and use of this in statistical production processes for improved outputs is an indispensable component in the implementation of KeSQAF.",
