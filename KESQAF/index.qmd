# Preface {.unnumbered}

This document presents the Kenya Statistical Quality Assurance Framework (KeSQAF), which provides a comprehensive system for ensuring the quality of official statistics produced in Kenya. 

The framework is based on the United Nations National Quality Assurance Framework (UN-NQAF) and is designed to guide the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) and other members of the National Statistical System in producing high-quality, credible, and reliable statistics.

## About This Framework

The KeSQAF consists of 19 quality principles organized into four levels:

- **Level A**: Managing the Statistical System
- **Level B**: Managing the Institutional Environment  
- **Level C**: Managing Statistical Processes
- **Level D**: Managing Statistical Outputs

Each principle includes specific requirements and elements to be assured, providing a comprehensive guide for statistical quality management in Kenya.

## Structure of This Document

This document is organized to provide both comprehensive coverage and easy navigation:

- **Chapter 1** covers the quality context and fundamental concepts
- **Chapter 2** describes Kenya's statistical system and its coordination
- **Chapter 3** presents the detailed quality assurance principles and requirements
- **Chapter 4** outlines the implementation framework and assessment procedures
- **Annexes** provide additional reference materials and detailed criteria

The framework serves as both a reference document for statistical practitioners and a guide for implementing quality assurance across Kenya's National Statistical System.
